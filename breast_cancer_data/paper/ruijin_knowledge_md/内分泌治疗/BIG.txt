abstract 

PURPOSE Luminal breast cancer has a long natural history, with recurrences continuing beyond 10 years after diagnosis. We analyzed long-term follow-up (LTFU) of efﬁcacy outcomes and adverse events in the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 study reported after a median follow-up of 12.6 years.

PATIENTS AND METHODS BIG 1-98 is a four-arm, phase III, double-blind, randomized trial comparing adjuvant letrozole versus tamoxifen (either treatment received for 5 years) and their sequences (2 years of one treatment plus 3 years of the other) for postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer. When pharmaceutical company sponsorship ended at 8.4 years of median follow-up, academic partners initiated an observational, LTFU extension collecting annual data on survival, disease status, and adverse events. Information from Denmark was from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Registry. Intention-to-treat analyses are reported. 

RESULTS Of 8,010 enrolled patients, 4,433 were alive and not withdrawn at an LTFU participating center, and 3,833 (86%) had at least one LTFU report. For the monotherapy comparison of letrozole versus tamoxifen, we found a 9% relative reduction in the hazard of a disease-free survival event with letrozole (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.01). HRs for other efﬁcacy end points were similar to those for disease-free survival. Efﬁcacy of letrozole versus tamoxifen for contralateral breast cancer varied signiﬁcantly over time (0- to 5-, 5- to 10-, and . 10-year HRs, 0.62, 0.47, and 1.35, respectively; treatment-by-time interaction P = .005), perhaps reﬂecting a longer carryover effect of tamoxifen. Reporting of speciﬁc long-term adverse events seemed more effective with national registry than with case-record reporting of clinical follow-up. CONCLUSION Efﬁcacy end points continued to show trends favoring letrozole. Letrozole reduced contralateral breast cancer frequency in the ﬁrst 10 years, but this reversed beyond 10 years.

INTRODUCTION Hormone receptor–positive early breast cancer has a long natural history, with disease and potentially adverse events (AEs) occurring beyond 10 years since initiation of treatment.1,2 Because regulatory bodies often require, at most, 10 years of follow-up in clinical trials, pharmaceutical partners rarely fund data collection beyond this point. The current study describes extended follow-up of the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial, one of the pivotal studies establishing the role of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in the 

adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with steroid hormone-receptor–positive early breast cancer. The BIG 1-98 trial has been described elsewhere.3-8 Brieﬂy, it compared 5 years of tamoxifen versus letrozole as monotherapy, and sequential treatment with 2 years of one of these drugs followed by 3 years of the other in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive early breast cancer. In our most recent report,8 we found letrozole monotherapy provided a signiﬁcant improvement in disease-free

survival (DFS), overall survival, distant recurrence-free interval, and breast cancer–free interval (BCFI) compared with tamoxifen monotherapy at median follow-up of 8.1 years since randomization. When the BIG 1-98 trial started as a Novartis-sponsored trial, it was intended to conduct long-term follow-up.3 In 2010, however, Novartis discontinued sponsorship and ﬁnancing of follow-up. The International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG), in collaboration with Breast International Group (BIG) partners, decided to continue follow-up and reporting from centers and groups that had conducted BIG 1-98 under contracts with academic organizations. This report presents results from the BIG 1-98 trial at a median follow-up of 12.6 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients BIG 1-98 was a randomized, phase III, double-blind trial that recruited postmenopausal women with early breast cancer positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or both. The details of trial design, eligibility criteria, and study procedures for BIG 1-98 have been presented previously.3-8 Initially, from 1998 to 2000, in centers under contract with Novartis, women were randomly assigned to receive monotherapy with letrozole (Femara; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) 2.5 mg orally daily or tamoxifen 20 mg orally daily for 5 years. In 1998, Novartis and IBCSG agreed to activate the four-arm BIG 1-98 trial in the BIG network, incorporate the prior two-arm randomizations and follow-up into BIG 1-98, and end random assignment to the two-arm option in 2000. Thus, from 1999 to 2003, patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: monotherapy with tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years or sequential therapy consisting of letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years, or tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years (four-arm option). The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included 8,010 patients from 247 participating centers in 27 countries. The schema for BIG 1-98 is shown in the Data Supplement. The BIG 1-98 long-term follow-up study (BIG 1-98 LTFU) was an observational extension of the BIG 1-98 trial, activated in 2011 to continue collection of a yearly update of survival, disease status, and long-term AEs beyond Novartis sponsorship. Patients who were alive and not withdrawn at the end of the original study could participate if they were enrolled from centers that had conducted the fourarm portion and had activated BIG 1-98 LTFU. A singlepage data collection form was required annually for all patients, with additional pages as needed to document death, recurrence, second malignancy, speciﬁed AEs, or use of certain medications. Information was obtained by clinic visit, telephone contact with patient, general physician, or family member, or from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) Registry for Danish 

participants (Data Supplement). A summary of the number of patients participating in the LTFU study is shown in Figure 1. A detailed ﬁgure of patient disposition according to treatment group is available in the Data Supplement. Statistical Analysis The primary efﬁcacy end point was DFS, deﬁned as the time since random assignment to the ﬁrst of the following events: invasive recurrence in local, regional, or distant sites; a new invasive cancer in the contralateral breast; any second (nonbreast) primary cancer; or death without a previous cancer event. Other end points previously reported were deﬁned using standardized deﬁnitions for efﬁcacy end points in adjuvant breast cancer trials criteria9 and include overall survival, distant recurrence-free interval, and invasive BCFI. We also analyzed breast cancer mortality, censoring deaths reported without a breast cancer event (ie, BCFI event), because median age at BIG 1-98 study entry was 61 years and deaths unrelated to breast cancer were expected during prolonged follow-up. Time to contralateral breast cancer was also analyzed, ignoring other events and censoring at last follow-up or death. For each time-to-event end point, separate analyses were performed for the monotherapy comparison (letrozole v tamoxifen using patients randomly assigned during either two-arm or four-arm options) and for sequential therapy comparisons versus tamoxifen monotherapy. Analyses were by ITT principle according to random assignment, ignoring the fact that 619 (25.2%) of 2,459 patients assigned to tamoxifen for the monotherapy comparison and 612 (39.5%) of 1,548 assigned to tamoxifen for the fourarm comparisons (Data Supplement) selectively crossed over to receive letrozole after release of ﬁrst results in 2005.3,5,8 Time-to-event end point analyses used data from all 8,010 patients in the BIG 1-98 ITT population. Because not all patients initially enrolled in BIG 1-98 were eligible for the BIG 1-98 LTFU study (Fig 1), weighted analyses as routinely applied in observational studies10-12 were used for Kaplan-Meier and Cox model estimates. The details of the weighting methods and other statistical analyses are presented in the Data Supplement. Brieﬂy, intervals of risk and events recorded during the original trial follow-up received a weight of 1, whereas those recorded during LTFU received a weight . 1 such that the information provided by each patient observed in the LTFU study counted not only for herself but also for other women with similar disease, treatment, demographics, and original trial experiences who did not have LTFU data collection. Cumulative incidence percentages for events deﬁning efﬁcacy end points were estimated as 100 minus the weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates. Weighted Cox models, stratiﬁed according to chemotherapy randomization

stratum, estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were determined on the basis of robust variance estimation. P values for tests of whether the HR differed from 1.0 were reported, not to make inference of whether the treatments were more efﬁcacious than tamoxifen, but as a complement to the CI for judging the play of chance in these analyses. All Cox models were assessed for nonproportional hazards by including an interaction term between treatment and time (continuous) as a time-dependent covariate. In instances where the P value for interaction was , .15, a piecewise Cox model was used to estimate HRs over three predeﬁned time intervals (0 to 5, 5 to 10, and . 10 years) to characterize the relationship between treatment effect and time (Data Supplement). Prespeciﬁed AEs recorded during LTFU were summarized using number and incidence per 1,000 patient-years of follow-up. Because Danish centers reported a subset of the 

Population Median follow-up for this extended analysis was 12.6 (interquartile range: 9.1 to 13.9) years, with a maximum follow-up of 17.7 years. This compares with a median followup of 8.1 (interquartile range: 7.3 to 9.5) years, with a maximum of 12.4 years at the most recent previous analysis of the original BIG 1-98 study.8 This LTFU report is based on a total of 83,271 patient-years of follow-up, a 32% increase in years of follow-up compared with the previous analysis. The characteristics of the patients with at least one LTFU contact were compared with those of the patients who were alive and not withdrawn at the end of the original BIG 1-98 but who did not have data provided for LTFU (Table 1). The patients with LTFU data were slightly younger at the time of enrolment in BIG 1-98 and had more advanced disease with slightly less node-negative disease and T1 stage compared with the cohort without any LTFU information. Fewer patients with BIG 1-98 LTFU data received adjuvant chemotherapy, and more received breast-conserving surgery than those not submitting LTFU data. There were no imbalances according to randomized treatment assignment. Efﬁcacy Results The cumulative incidence of efﬁcacy end point events for the monotherapy comparison of letrozole for 5 years versus tamoxifen for 5 years are shown in Figure 2. There was a nonsigniﬁcant, 9% reduction in the hazard of a DFS event with letrozole compared with tamoxifen over the entire time of observation (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.01; P = .08; Fig 2A). The early effect of letrozole was maintained over time; however, the magnitude in favor of letrozole seemed to be slightly diminished compared with the results at 8.1 years of median follow-up. For the monotherapy population, there was no evidence of variation of the treatment effect over time (treatment-by-time interaction P = .22). Other end points including overall survival, time to distant recurrence-free interval, and BCFI maintained similar HRs as in earlier reports, though the magnitude of the advantage for letrozole was numerically reduced (Fig 2B-2D; see Data Supplement for results of ITT analyses at 8.1 years and 12.6 years of follow-up). Breast cancer mortality showed no evidence of variation of the treatment effect over time (treatment-by-time interaction P = .80) in the monotherapy comparison. The results showed a nonsigniﬁcant 11% reduction in breast cancer mortality with letrozole (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.07; P = .20; Fig 2E).

Efﬁcacy end point results according to nodal status are shown in the Data Supplement. The HRs comparing letrozole versus tamoxifen were similar across nodal groups, but, as expected, the absolute differences favoring letrozole were greater for the node-positive cohort. Contralateral and Nonbreast Primaries We detected a clear beneﬁt of letrozole over tamoxifen in preventing contralateral breast cancer over the ﬁrst 10 years, which was numerically reversed over the period beyond 10 years. During the original study, 48 contralateral breast cancer events were reported in the letrozole arm versus 75 in the tamoxifen arm, whereas during the LTFU study, there were 29 in the letrozole arm and 15 in the tamoxifen arm (Table 2). HRs for time to contralateral breast cancer for letrozole versus tamoxifen were 0.62 (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.09) for years 0 to 5, 0.47 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.97) for years 5 to 10, and 1.35 (0.53 to 3.41) for years 10 or longer (treatment-by-time interaction P = .005). Throughout follow-up, there was an 18% increase in the occurrence of second nonbreast primaries in patients receiving tamoxifen monotherapy, largely owing to an excess of endometrial cancer during the original study period (Table 2). AEs Reported Clinically and by a Registry Most of the predeﬁned AEs were reported at similar rates in the two arms during LTFU (Table 3). Of particular note is the lack of difference in osteoporosis/osteopenia and fracture rate between tamoxifen and letrozole. Myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events showed no signiﬁcant differences between the arms, but a higher rate of other cardiac events (hypertension, cardiac insufﬁciency, supraventricular arrhythmia and valve disorders) was reported in the letrozole arm. Thromboembolic events were more commonly reported in the letrozole arm during LTFU. In this trial two different kinds of reporting of long-term AEs were used. The data of Danish patients were uploaded annually from DBCG (capturing data from nationwide 

Danish health registries). As seen in Table 3, the Danish DBCG registry reported more speciﬁc events like myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident, and thromboembolism, whereas additional “other cardiac events” were recorded from centers using nonregistry reporting. Comparisons of Sequential Arms Versus Monotherapy The cumulative incidence of efﬁcacy end points for the four-arm comparisons of letrozole, tamoxifen, and their sequences are shown in the Data Supplement. Outcomes achieved with the sequence of letrozole taken for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years were close to those obtained by assignment to 5 years of letrozole monotherapy. For example, cumulative incidence for a DFS event, comparing letrozole monotherapy versus the letrozole to tamoxifen sequence, were within one percentage point of each other during follow-up: 12.3% versus 12.6% at 5 years, 26.0% versus 26.8% at 10 years, and 35.5% versus 36.2% at 14 years, respectively. DISCUSSION Over the past 20 years, there has been a trend to cease follow-up of adjuvant therapy clinical trials after approximately 10 years, which has limited the available data about AIs for postmenopausal women. Other adjuvant endocrine therapy trials like the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial, the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial, and the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) reported their long-term outcome at 10 years,13-15 whereas the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) reported a cohort of their Trial 8 at 11 years correlating the risk of late recurrence with PAM50 risk of recurrence.16,17 The present report of LTFU at a median of 12.6 years in the BIG 1-98 study thus represents the longest currently available follow-up of trials investigating adjuvant AI therapy. Methodologically, the additional long-term follow-up constitutes a long-term observational study within a clearly deﬁned study

subpopulation from a prospective randomized trial. We used a weighted analysis methodology to include efﬁcacy data for patients unavailable for LTFU. Another special feature of this investigation was the availability of efﬁcacy end point data and AEs captured annually from a central registry for all Danish participants. The protocol-deﬁned primary DFS end point still showed a relative risk reduction of 9% in favor of the letrozole arm after a median follow-up of 12.6 years, the same as the 9% risk reduction seen with anastrozole in the 10-year analysis of the ATAC trial.13 In BIG 1-98, the letrozole advantage in terms of DFS in this ITT analysis was marginally less than in previous reports. The other efﬁcacy end points also showed slightly attenuated HRs in favor of the letrozole arm compared with the previous ITT analysis after 8.1 years of follow-up (see Data Supplement for discussion).8 A reason for some attenuation of letrozole beneﬁt in DFS over time may be the accumulation of nonbreast events as a result of the age of the observed population. The median age at inclusion was 61 years; after 12.6 years of follow-up, on average, many of these women are approaching their eighties and are at risk for death without a previous cancer event. The end point breast cancer mortality, perhaps the least likely to be diluted by intercurrent deaths, showed a relative hazard reduction of 11% in favor of letrozole therapy. Another reason for reduced DFS difference could be a more effective carryover of prevention of contralateral breast cancer seen with tamoxifen during LTFU. The long carryover effect of tamoxifen was also seen in the 16-year 

follow-up of the IBIS-l study, in which 5 years of preventive tamoxifen was compared with placebo and the preventive effect of tamoxifen remained similar throughout 20 years.18 In the long-term follow-up of ATAC and the IES, more contralateral breast cancer events were reported in the tamoxifen arm, but without analysis of the incidence during different time periods.13,14 New primary cancers at nonbreast sites were numerically similar in the various treatment arms during BIG 1-98 LTFU. Finally, the selective crossover to letrozole of 25.2% of patients assigned to tamoxifen for the monotherapy comparison and 39.5% of the patients assigned to tamoxifen for the four-arm comparison could also have contributed to improved outcome for those assigned to tamoxifen and the attenuation of letrozole beneﬁt observed in these ITT analyses. We found no relevant differences between the arms regarding occurrence of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, osteoporosis, or fracture rates during LTFU. These reassuring observations are consistent with the result of the long-term follow-up of the ATAC trial.13 Previously expressed concerns about the potential long-term increased risk for ischemic cardiovascular events associated with AI therapy19 seem to be unfounded. The thromboembolic event rate was lower in the tamoxifen arm during LTFU. This may reﬂect more effective prophylaxis administered for patients deemed to be at higher risk as a result of earlier tamoxifen exposure. The higher incidence of other cardiac events in the letrozole arm included many different disorders and is difﬁcult to interpret in an ageing population.

NOTE. The number of patients with the adverse event and the incidence rate per 1,000 patient-years of follow-up are reported both for all patients with data submitted for BIG 1-98 LTFU and separately for the non-Danish and Danish participants, owing to differences in the data sources. Abbreviations: CVA, cerebrovascular accident; GE, greater than or equal to; LTFU, long-term follow-up; MI, myocardial infarction; TIA, transient ischemic attack. *Other cardiac conditions comprised primarily hypertension, cardiac insufﬁciency, supraventricular arrhythmia, and several valve disorders, with some deaths ﬁnally recorded as heart failure. †Arthralgia GE grade 2, myalgia GE grade 2, and osteoporosis/osteopenia data were not available from Denmark, so denominators and results are exclusively from the non-Danish patient cohorts. ‡Danish data report bone fractures only if the event required hospitalization. 

This study affords the opportunity to compare AE reports from clinical and registry sources. For the monotherapy comparison (Table 3), 29 (78%) of the 37 myocardial infarctions were reported from Danish centers, which had 28% 

of LTFU patients. The results illustrate the value of national health registries in those countries such as Denmark, which include detailed clinical information on registered patients with cancer.

Long-Term Follow-Up of the BIG1-98 Study 

An important feature of the BIG 1-98 study is the ability to compare letrozole monotherapy for 5 years versus the sequence of letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years. AIs and tamoxifen have toxicity proﬁles leading to nonadherence in a meaningful proportion of patients. The similar outcomes in the four-arm comparison for letrozole monotherapy or the sequence of letrozole followed by tamoxifen suggest switching to tamoxifen instead of stopping all therapy is a viable option for patients who are intolerant to initial AI therapy, especially because the toxicity proﬁles of an AI and tamoxifen are often individually different. 

pharmaceutical company support, resulting in attenuated follow-up for approximately 30% of eligible patients (Fig 1). This limitation was mitigated by use of weighted analyses adjusting for differences in characteristics between patients with and without LTFU data, and the fact that closure of entire centers rather than exclusion of individual patients accounted for 75% of patients without LTFU data. 

Although there are challenges to the successful conduct of LTFU,20 it is important to prospectively plan for the longterm follow-up of clinical trials that support regulatory approval of a new widely used treatment regimen, especially for a disease such as early, endocrine-responsive breast cancer. A limitation of our study is the closure of 167 of the 247 participating centers upon withdrawal of 

The BIG 1-98 LTFU study shows continued, albeit modest and slightly attenuated, beneﬁt of initial letrozole rather than tamoxifen for postmenopausal women with endocrineresponsive early breast cancer. Contralateral breast cancer incidence was lower in the ﬁrst 10 years with letrozole, whereas after year 10 it was less frequent following tamoxifen with a statistically signiﬁcant interaction between treatment and time. Second nonbreast primary cancer was not different during LTFU. The reporting of some long-term AEs was apparently more complete from a nationwide clinical registry than with routine clinical follow-up.
