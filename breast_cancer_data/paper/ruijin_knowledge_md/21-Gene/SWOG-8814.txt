node-positive disease was both oestrogen-receptor positive and HER2 negative (ERBB2 negative).11,14,15 Consequently, we analysed the 21-gene recurrence score assay in a phase 3 node-positive trial that contained a tamoxifen-only control group.16 Our two co-primary objectives were to establish whether the assay provides prognostic information for women with node-positive disease treated only with tamoxifen, and whether the assay allows prediction of a node-positive group that does not beneﬁt from anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)-8814, INT0100 study was a phase 3, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial.16 The study design and main results of the trial have been reported elsewhere.16 Brieﬂy, postmenopausal women with axillary node-positive breast cancer were eligible for inclusion if they had oestrogen-receptor-positive or progesteronereceptor-positive tumours, or both, classiﬁed by local institutional standards. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned in a 2:3:3 ratio to one of three drug regimens: (1) tamoxifen alone (20 mg per day orally) for 5 years; (2) six cycles of CAF (cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m² orally on days 1–14, doxorubicin 30 mg/m² intravenously on days 1 and 8, and ﬂuorouracil 500 mg/m² intravenously on days 1 and 8)17 followed by tamoxifen (CAF-T); or (3) CAF with concurrent tamoxifen (CAFT).

CAF cycles were repeated every 28 days. Randomisation was done by computer-generated sequence and stratiﬁed by number of positive nodes (1–3 vs ≥4), progesteronereceptor status (positive vs negative), and interval from surgery (≤6 weeks vs >6 weeks). The primary endpoint of SWOG-8814 was disease-free survival, deﬁned as time from registration to breastcancer relapse (local or distant), new primary breast cancer, or death due to any cause, whichever came ﬁrst. Overall survival was calculated from registration to death due to any cause. Patients without an event were censored at the last follow-up visit. After mature 10-year survival data were obtained, follow-up for recurrence ended because of ﬁnancial constraints, but known deaths are still recorded. The combined chemotherapy groups (CAF-T and CAFT) showed superior disease-free survival and overall survival over 10 years compared with the tamoxifen group.16 The addition of chemotherapy sequentially (CAF-T) was better than simultaneous treatment (CAFT). Patients with four or more positive nodes derived more beneﬁt from chemotherapy than did those with one to three positive nodes, but CAF beneﬁt remained after adjustment for nodal status and other variables. 

Translational study design This translational study, approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI #8814A-ICSC), was led by SWOG for The Breast Cancer Intergroup of North America and is reported according to the Reporting Recommendations for Tumour Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK).18 When enrolled on SWOG-8814, we asked patients for permission for central banking of their paraﬃn-embedded tumours for future studies. Consenting patients signed a separate informed consent document for assessment of biomarkers measured in tumour tissue in relation to outcome (protocol SWOG-9445). Laboratory personnel at Genomic Health (Redwood City, CA, USA), who were masked to patient clinical data including outcome, undertook the 21-gene recurrence score assay (Oncotype DX). The design and statistical plan were ﬁnalised before merging the assay results and clinical data and analysing the data at the SWOG Statistical Center. The study was approved by an independent central institutional review board. Because of the inferior eﬃcacy of the CAFT regimen compared with the CAF-T regimen in the parent trial, we excluded CAFT from this analysis, and therefore only compared the sequential CAF-T group with the tamoxifen control group. The RT-PCR assay was done on the 21 prespeciﬁed genes (16 cancer-related genes—including groups related to oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, proliferation, HER2, and invasion—and ﬁve reference genes) by use of isolated RNA from ﬁxed, paraﬃnembedded tissue, in accordance with standardised methods.1 The recurrence score was derived from www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 11 January 2010

reference-normalised gene-expression measurements, and ranged from 0 to 100. Tumour grade was assessed centrally (by FLB) by use of the modiﬁed Bloom-Richardson score from haemotoxylineosin-stained tissue sections. In a previous exploratory biomarker study,11 we undertook central immunohistochemistry (scored by DCA) for oestrogen receptor by the Allred score,19 HER2 by TAB250, and P53 on most samples available in the current study. 

Statistical analysis The primary, prespeciﬁed outcome of the translational study was disease-free survival, with overall survival as a secondary endpoint, as in the parent trial. Since the distant recurrence-free interval was not available, we undertook an exploratory analysis of breast-cancerspeciﬁc survival. In this exploratory analysis, only deaths due to breast cancer were events, censoring all deaths not due to breast cancer at time of death and alive patients at the last follow-up visit. We used 

two-sided α=0·05 signiﬁcance levels. The primary analysis speciﬁed modelling continuous recurrence score as a linear term in a Cox regression model. Although analyses used recurrence score as a continuous variable, secondary analyses used the clinical recurrence score categories of low (<18), intermediate (18–30), and high (≥31).1 For the ﬁrst co-primary objective, the prognostic eﬀect of recurrence score, we examined whether higher recurrence score was associated with shorter disease-free survival in the tamoxifen-alone group. The second co-primary objective of the predictive eﬀect of the recurrence score was tested by including an interaction term of continuous recurrence score and chemotherapy in the model. This model tested whether the diﬀerence in outcome from randomised treatment depended on increasing recurrence score. Cox regression models were adjusted for number of positive nodes (1–3 vs ≥4), a stratifying, highly prognostic factor from the parent trial. The assumption of

proportional hazards, tested in each model, was satisﬁed apart from when recurrence score was included in the model, suggesting that the eﬀect of recurrence score was not constant over the entire time period. Thus, the time axis was divided into less than 5 years and 5 years or more (at the end of tamoxifen therapy and midway in follow-up), allowing estimation and testing of diﬀerent hazard ratios (HRs) for each time period. Cox models for each period showed no violation of proportional hazards. We constructed Kaplan-Meier survival plots and used log-rank tests (stratiﬁed by number of positive nodes) of survival truncated at 10 years (because of low numbers at risk after 10 years) to test diﬀerences between survival curves. Cox models included 13 years of follow-up to reﬂect the entire follow-up period and since 58 

the models are less aﬀected by the low numbers at risk after 10 years. To determine the estimated probability of a disease-free survival event by 5 or 10 years, the linear recurrence score was allowed to have time-varying eﬀects by means of a ﬂexible proportional odds approach20 that included number of positive nodes (1–3 vs ≥4) as a covariate. For graphs showing risk of disease-free survival event by recurrence score and treatment, we presented prediction of CAF beneﬁt for recurrence score of 50 or lower because of high uncertainty at greater recurrence score levels. In these graphs, we also showed risks separately for the prognostic strata of one to three positive nodes and four or more positive nodes.21 Statistical analyses were done with Stata version 10.1. 

Role of the funding sources The design of the study was approved by The Breast Cancer Intergroup of North America, SWOG, and Genomic Health, and subsequently approved by independent peer review by the National Cancer Institute. Tumour assays were undertaken by laboratory personnel at Genomic Health who had no knowledge of treatment assignment or clinical outcome. These data were then merged with clinical data at the SWOG Statistical Center. The study biostatistician (WEB) had the only direct access to all data in the study. Analytical results were conﬁrmed by Genomic Health statisticians (CY, RB) by visiting the SWOG Statistical Center. Four authors (SS, RB, FLB, CY) are employees of a sponsor and contributed to the interpretation and writing of the report. The report was drafted in its entirety by the authors without beneﬁt of paid assistance. Content of the ﬁnal report was not subject to approval from the National Cancer Institute or the corporate sponsor. The corresponding author had ﬁnal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 

Results Tumour samples were available for 664 (45%) of the 1477 patients in SWOG-8814 (ﬁgure 1), including 413 (45%) of the 927 patients in the CAF-T and tamoxifen groups. RT-PCR analysis was feasible in 367 (40%) specimens from the tamoxifen and CAF-T groups (tamoxifen, 148 [89%] of 166 samples; CAF-T, 219 [89%] of 247), suggesting no bias by group in sample availability. Analyses were not done for the remaining 46 (11%) of samples because of exhaustion of invasive tumour in the block, no submission of primary tumour, or technical issues. The subset of patients analysed in this study were representative of those in the parent trial by age, ethnic origin, progesterone-receptor status, and duration of follow-up (table 1). However, patients in this subset had a slightly lower number of positive nodes and a smaller tumour size than did those in the parent trial. 11·7% of patients in this analysis were HER2-positive based on www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 11 January 2010

the 21-gene assay. The recurrence score was distributed over the three risk levels and balanced between treatment groups. The beneﬁt in disease-free survival for CAF-T versus tamoxifen alone in the parent trial was similar to that seen in this subset of patients after adjustment for number of positive nodes. The HR for disease-free survival for chemotherapy versus tamoxifen was 0·69 (95% CI 0·56–0·84; p=0·0003) in the parent trial and 0·72 (0·51–1·00; p=0·048) for this subset. The HR for overall survival was 0·78 (0·63–0·97; p=0·024) in the parent trial and 0·77 (0·52–1·14; p=0·19) in this subset, adjusted for number of positive nodes. The recurrence score was highly prognostic for disease-free survival within the tamoxifen-alone group (ﬁgure 2A), stratiﬁed by number of positive nodes (p=0·017). The 10-year disease-free survival estimates were 60%, 49%, and 43% for low, intermediate, and 

high-risk categories, respectively. In a Cox regression model, the continuous recurrence score was highly signiﬁcant (p=0·006), with HR 2·64 (95% CI 1·33–5·27) for a 50-point diﬀerence. The HR for recurrence score was not constant over time by the test for proportional hazards (p=0·0016). In the ﬁrst 5 years, the HR was 5·55 (2·32–3·28; p=0·0002). For those patients who survived beyond 5 years, the recurrence score was no longer prognostic (HR 0·86, 0·27–2·74; p=0·80), but the initial strong eﬀect persisted over the entire period. The recurrence score risk category was prognostic for overall survival over 10 years (stratiﬁed log-rank p=0·003) in the tamoxifen-alone group (ﬁgure 2B). The 10-year overall survival estimates for patients with low, intermediate, and high recurrence scores were 77%, 68%, and 51%, respectively. After adjustment for number of positive nodes, the HR for overall survival was 4·42 (95% CI 1·96–9·97; p=0·0006) for a 50-point

diﬀerence, with similar failure of proportional hazards assumption over time (p=0·0005). The recurrence score was a strong predictive factor of beneﬁt from CAF for disease-free survival. Figure 3A shows improved disease-free survival over 10 years for CAF-T versus tamoxifen alone in the entire recurrence score sample (stratiﬁed log-rank p=0·054, adjusted for number of positive nodes), but degree of CAF beneﬁt depended on the recurrence score. There was no apparent beneﬁt for scores of less than 18 (ﬁgure 3B, stratiﬁed log-rank p=0·97; HR 1·02, 95% CI 0·54–1·93) or between 18 and 30 (ﬁgure 3C, stratiﬁed log-rank p=0·48; HR 0·72, 0·39–1·31). However, there was a signiﬁcant advantage of treatment with CAF-T compared with tamoxifen for patients with a recurrence score of 31 or more (ﬁgure 3D, stratiﬁed log-rank p=0·033; HR 0·59, 0·35–1·01). 10-year disease-free survival estimates in patients with a low recurrence score were 64% for the CAF-T group versus 60% for the tamoxifen group and, for those with high recurrence score, 55% versus 43%, respectively. Similar diﬀerences in the predictive value of the recurrence score were seen for overall survival over 10 years. There was no signiﬁcant beneﬁt from CAF for patients with a low (stratiﬁed log-rank p=0·63, ﬁgure 4A) or intermediate (stratiﬁed log-rank p=0·85, ﬁgure 4C) recurrence score. However, there was a signiﬁcant beneﬁt from CAF in patients with a high recurrence score (stratiﬁed log-rank p=0·027, ﬁgure 4E), which did not vary by age (data not shown). 10-year estimates for overall survival in patients with a high recurrence score were 68% for the CAF-T group and 51% for the tamoxifen group. Corresponding HRs for overall survival for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy after adjustment for number of positive nodes were 1·18 (95% CI 0·55–2·54; p=0·68) for patients with a low recurrence score, 0·84 (0·40–1·78; p=0·65) for intermediate recurrence score, and 0·56 (0·31–1·02; p=0·057) for high recurrence score. Similar outcomes were seen for breast-cancer-speciﬁc survival (ﬁgure 4B, D, F), with 10-year estimates for patients with a high recurrence score of 73% for the CAF-T group and 54% for the tamoxifen group (stratiﬁed log-rank p=0·033). Figure 5 shows HRs for disease-free survival for beneﬁt from CAF for the parent trial, the entire recurrence score subset, and then by categorised recurrence score. HRs in the parent trial and the entire recurrence score subset show a consistent beneﬁt over time (ie, proportional hazards), with an eﬀect of chemotherapy lasting beyond 5 years. The data for the high recurrence score subset are suggestive of an even stronger beneﬁt that also persists over time. Failure of the proportional hazards assumption is seen for the low and intermediate risk groups, which have inconsistent eﬀects over time. There is no suggestion of beneﬁt in the low-risk group overall or in the ﬁrst 5 years. In the intermediate group, there might be slight beneﬁt overall, but not in the ﬁrst 5 years. Conﬁdence intervals are wide because of small numbers of later events. www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 11 January 2010

Table 2: Disease-free survival hazard ratios adjusted for number of positive nodes for chemotherapy beneﬁt by recurrence score over time 

The primary analysis of prediction was to test increasing chemotherapy beneﬁt as the linear recurrence score increased. We analysed the interaction of treatment eﬀect and the linear recurrence score, adjusting for number of positive nodes (1–3 vs ≥4). Table 2 shows the model, calibrated to recurrence score 0 as the referent and recurrence score/50 (ie, corresponds to a 50-point diﬀerence). Over the entire period, the recurrence score 61

by treatment interaction is p=0·053 for disease-free survival. However, the eﬀect of the recurrence score on treatment is not constant over time: recurrence score predicts chemotherapy beneﬁt in the ﬁrst 5 years (interaction p=0·029), but not after 5 years (interaction p=0·58). Nevertheless, the cumulative beneﬁt of CAF persists up to 10 years. In the analysis of overall survival, there was a signiﬁcant interaction of recurrence score and treatment over the entire period (p=0·026) and in the ﬁrst 5 years (p=0·016), but not after 5 years (p=0·87). Therefore, recurrence score has both strong prognostic and predictive eﬀects on survival in the ﬁrst 5 years, but limited additional eﬀects in women surviving beyond 5 years (except in those with a higher recurrence score). The strong initial eﬀects carry forward suﬃciently so that overall diﬀerences are still seen at late timepoints. Figure 6A shows prediction of any disease-free survival event within 10 years by number of positive nodes, treatment, and recurrence score. Increasing involvement of axillary lymph nodes was prognostic for disease-free 

survival. The treatments start diverging at a recurrence score of approximately 10, although any clinically signiﬁcant beneﬁt from CAF is not evident until a much higher recurrence score. Because the recurrence score has better short-term than long-term prediction, estimates at 5 years are shown in ﬁgure 6B. The treatments are equivalent up to a recurrence score of approximately 20, but diverge at higher recurrence score values. The 95% prediction intervals around the estimates are shown in webappendix p 2–3. These bounds are speciﬁc to a particular recurrence score value so cannot be used to test the signiﬁcance of chemotherapy beneﬁt, which depends on a range of recurrence score values. We assessed whether other markers measured by central pathological review could predict degree of chemotherapy beneﬁt as eﬀectively as the recurrence score risk categories. Tumour grade was prognostic for disease-free survival overall (p=0·008), but did not interact with prediction of chemotherapy beneﬁt (p=0·26). 316 (86%) samples with a recurrence score had data for oestrogen receptor expression by Allred scoring,19 352 (96%) samples had HER2 by TAB250, and 312 (85%) had both. The best cut-oﬀ point for clinical use of Allred-scored oestrogen receptor was 0–6 (n=147, 47%) versus 7–8 (n=169, 53%) with a marginal predictive eﬀect (p=0·16). There might be a beneﬁt from CAF if the disease was HER2-positive or oestrogen-receptor score was six or lower (n=170, p=0·06, stratiﬁed log-rank test at 10 years). However, there was no beneﬁt in disease-free survival if oestrogen-receptor score was high (7 or 8) and the disease was HER2 negative (n=142, p=0·81). In this latter group, 58% of patients had a low recurrence score, 24% had an intermediate score, and 18% had a high score. The interaction of treatment beneﬁt and recurrence score remained signiﬁcant after adjustment for age, ethnic origin, tumour size, progesterone status, grade, P53, and HER2 by TAB250. Because oestrogen-receptor expression is a part of the recurrence score, adjustment for Allred-scored oestrogen-receptor expression made the interaction non-signiﬁcant (p=0·15). There was a moderate negative (–0·38) correlation of Allred-scored oestrogen receptor with recurrence score, although some tumours with high oestrogen-receptor expression (by Allred score or by RT-PCR from the recurrence score assay) had a high recurrence score (webappendix p 4–5). Thus, the predictive capability of the recurrence score might not be completely captured by consideration of known markers measured by immunohistochemistry. 

Discussion Our study suggests that patients with involved axillary lymph nodes, but a low recurrence score, do not seem to beneﬁt from anthracycline-based chemotherapy, whereas those with a higher recurrence score have major beneﬁt, independent of the number of positive nodes.

cohort of 106 patients with one to three positive nodes. In a subset of patients who were identiﬁed as low risk by the 70-gene proﬁle,3 patients given chemotherapy had similar survival to those who were not.22 Taken together, these data suggest that there could be subgroups of patients within the oestrogen-receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer population that do not respond in the expected way to chemotherapy, and that these subgroups can be identiﬁed by use of multigene assays.23,24 This study challenges the current treatment standard of adjuvant chemotherapy for all women with positive axillary nodes and oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer.25 This standard is based on several decades of phase 3 clinical trials that showed a survival beneﬁt from chemotherapy when added to endocrine therapy alone in premenopausal women and more recently, postmenopausal women.10,11,26 In a recent international survey, identiﬁcation of a molecular signature to select patients who could be spared chemotherapy was voted the highest translational research priority in breast cancer worldwide.27 Avoidance of the toxic eﬀects and other costs of adjuvant chemotherapy when it might not be needed is an important goal in breast cancer treatment. There is a continuing debate about the role of the recurrence score and other multigene assays in addition to standard pathology variables for prognosis and prediction. Whereas the 21-gene recurrence score assay provides a reproducible method to classify the biology of a given patient’s tumour for prediction of chemotherapy beneﬁt, standard pathology testing might provide another means of determining chemotherapy beneﬁt. In exploratory, post-hoc analyses, high levels of oestrogenreceptor protein expression (“endocrine responsiveness”) measured centrally predicted no beneﬁt from chemotherapy.11–13,26 Additionally, St Gallen guidelines endorse the use of degree of endocrine responsiveness in chemotherapy decision making.26,28 In our study, a subset of patients with a high concentration of oestrogenreceptor protein and HER2-negative disease did not seem to beneﬁt from CAF added to tamoxifen. A much larger study would be needed to show a signiﬁcant increase in prediction using a multigene assay after accounting for standard pathological assays. In part, this increase in sample size is attributable to measuring the same pathways by both methods, so one method must have much less measurement error to show improvement. However, our exploratory analysis and those of others have been consistent in showing that a signiﬁcant interaction between multigene assay and chemotherapy beneﬁt is maintained after adjustment for standard factors.1,24,29,30 The recurrence score assay provided better discrimination of individual tumour behaviour and a more reliable prediction of patients who would beneﬁt versus those who would not than did the traditional assays in these studies. Furthermore, there is a 25–30% discordance rate between risk levels predicted by standard variables www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 11 January 2010 

and multigene assays.24 Continuing prospective trials should answer how to best select therapy when this discordance exists. For now, the most recent St Gallen guidelines allow the use of multigene assays to select adjuvant therapy.28 It remains to be shown that less costly and more available assays would actually lead to diﬀerent clinical decisions about treatment. That said, in decision-making studies the use of multigene assays result in a change in treatment plan about a third of the time, and this change is usually to avoid chemotherapy when it was initially thought to be needed before the assay.6–8,24 There are limitations to our results. This study included a population of postmenopausal women with oestrogenreceptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer, so whether the ﬁndings translate to premenopausal patients is unclear. However, the performance of the assay in nodenegative disease was the same across all ages.1,5 Our results with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and those of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) study with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and ﬂuorouracil5 are based on older standards of chemotherapy, so the predictive value of the recurrence score assay might diﬀer in current practice when other types of chemotherapy or dosing schedules are used. Although high recurrence scores are associated with more pathological complete remissions from taxanes given in the neoadjuvant setting,31 recurrence score prediction of taxane eﬃcacy from phase 3 trials is not available. Nonetheless, this analysis and others with diﬀerent gene proﬁles suggest that certain biological subtypes of breast cancer might be inherently sensitive or resistant to chemotherapy in general. Our retrospective analysis included a subset of patients from SWOG-8814, although overall treatment eﬀect and demographics were similar to those in the parent trial. In view of the low endpoint event rate, especially in the low recurrence score group, CIs were broad; therefore, estimated beneﬁt of CAF at speciﬁc recurrence score values should be interpreted with caution. Whereas there was no apparent beneﬁt from CAF in patients with a low recurrence score for all endpoints, the possibility of beneﬁt cannot be completely ruled out. The lack of proportional hazards seen in our study is substantiated by previous reports about the major eﬀect of adjuvant chemotherapy in the ﬁrst years of follow-up,10 the indolent nature of luminal A biology over time,32,33 and early-onset recurrence in tumours with a high recurrence score.1 Finally, our study used disease-free survival as the primary endpoint, since unlike the NSABP analysis,1 we did not prospectively collect data for distant recurrence-free interval. Thus, the prognostic and predictive eﬀects of the recurrence score might diﬀer because of the inclusion of disease-free survival events such as second primary cancers and breast recurrences. However, the results for breast-cancer-speciﬁc survival were also consistent. 63

Thus, our study provides further data on the value of a multigene assay for prognosis in patients with oestrogenreceptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. Moreover, our results suggest that the 21-gene recurrence score assay might predict which of these patients derive beneﬁt from an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen and those who may not, despite higher risk because of positive nodes. Current treatment guidelines generally recommend chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer.25 Prospective studies with larger sample sizes are essential to establish who beneﬁts most from modern endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy, and whether use of multigene assays aﬀects survival.
