Background Pathological complete response has been proposed as a surrogate endpoint for prediction of long-term clinical beneﬁt, such as disease-free survival, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). We had four key objectives: to establish the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS, to establish the deﬁnition of pathological complete response that correlates best with long-term outcome, to identify the breast cancer subtypes in which pathological complete response is best correlated with long-term outcome, and to assess whether an increase in frequency of pathological complete response between treatment groups predicts improved EFS and OS. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, and Medline for clinical trials of neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. To be eligible, studies had to meet three inclusion criteria: include at least 200 patients with primary breast cancer treated with preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery; have available data for pathological complete response, EFS, and OS; and have a median follow-up of at least 3 years. We compared the three most commonly used deﬁnitions of pathological complete response—ypT0 ypN0, ypT0/is ypN0, and ypT0/is—for their association with EFS and OS in a responder analysis. We assessed the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS in various subgroups. Finally, we did a trial-level analysis to assess whether pathological complete response could be used as a surrogate endpoint for EFS or OS. Findings We obtained data from 12 identiﬁed international trials and 11 955 patients were included in our responder analysis. Eradication of tumour from both breast and lymph nodes (ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0) was better associated with improved EFS (ypT0 ypN0: hazard ratio [HR] 0·44, 95% CI 0·39–0·51; ypT0/is ypN0: 0·48, 0·43–0·54) and OS (0·36, 0·30–0·44; 0·36, 0·31–0·42) than was tumour eradication from the breast alone (ypT0/is; EFS: HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·55–0·66; OS 0·51, 0·45–0·58). We used the ypT0/is ypN0 deﬁnition for all subsequent analyses. The association between pathological complete response and long-term outcomes was strongest in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (EFS: HR 0·24, 95% CI 0·18–0·33; OS: 0·16, 0·11–0·25) and in those with HER2-positive, hormone-receptornegative tumours who received trastuzumab (EFS: 0·15, 0·09–0·27; OS: 0·08, 0·03, 0·22). In the trial-level analysis, we recorded little association between increases in frequency of pathological complete response and EFS (R²=0·03, 95% CI 0·00–0·25) and OS (R²=0·24, 0·00–0·70). Interpretation Patients who attain pathological complete response deﬁned as ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0 have improved survival. The prognostic value is greatest in aggressive tumour subtypes. Our pooled analysis could not validate pathological complete response as a surrogate endpoint for improved EFS and OS. Funding US Food and Drug Administration. 

Introduction New agents to treat breast cancer have historically been approved ﬁrst in the metastatic setting, with approval for use in early-stage breast cancer following many years later on the basis of results of large randomised adjuvant trials with long follow-up. Neoadjuvant treatment— systemic therapy delivered before deﬁnitive breast cancer surgery—was once reserved to reduce the size and extent of locally advanced tumours, but is now being used more widely. In addition to increasing the likelihood of tumour control and the potential for curability in early breast cancer, neoadjuvant trials allow rapid assessment of drug eﬃcacy and could expedite development and approval of 

treatments for early breast cancer.1 Pathological complete response has been proposed as a surrogate endpoint for prediction of long-term clinical beneﬁt, such as diseasefree survival and overall survival (OS).2–5 Although pathological complete response has been the most commonly used endpoint in neoadjuvant trials, it has been variably deﬁned, which has made reporting and interpretation of data challenging. One way to optimise the deﬁnition of pathological complete response, enable the interpretation of data, and investigate the association between pathological complete response and long-term outcome is via a pooled analysis of neoadjuvant trials.

analysis, the US Food and Drug Administration established an international working group known as Collaborative Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) with investigators who had done neoadjuvant trials for which long-term data are available. We aimed to investigate the potential of pathological complete response as a surrogate endpoint for long-term outcomes. We had four key objectives: to establish the association between pathological complete response and event-free survival (EFS) and OS, to establish the deﬁnition of pathological complete response that correlates best with long-term outcome, to identify the breast cancer subtypes in which pathological complete response is best correlated with long-term outcome, and to assess whether an increase in frequency of pathological complete response predicts improved EFS and OS. Here, we present initial results from the CTNeoBC pooled analysis. 

Methods Search strategy and selection criteria We searched PubMed, Embase, and Medline for reports of clinical trials of neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer published between Jan 1, 1990, and Aug 1, 2011. To be eligible, studies had to meet three inclusion criteria: include at least 200 patients with primary breast cancer treated with preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery; have available data for pathological complete response, EFS, and OS; and have a median follow-up of at least 3 years. Investigators from identiﬁed trials were invited to participate in a collaborative analysis and agreed to provide individual patient data. We excluded data from all patients randomised to postoperative treatment, patients in the HER2-negative treatment group of the NOAH trial (necessary data were unavailable for this group), and patients who never began assigned treatment. 

occurrence of disease progression resulting in inoperability, locoregional recurrence (after neoadjuvant therapy), distant metastases, or death from any cause. Patients alive without an event as of the analysis cutoﬀ date were censored at last study follow-up date. Overall survival was calculated from date of randomisation to death. For patients alive on the data cutoﬀ date, survival was censored at last study follow-up date. 

Statistical analysis In the pooled analysis, we categorised patients who either did not undergo surgery or who had surgery but for whom data were missing for pathological complete response as non-pathological complete responders. We compared the three deﬁnitions of pathological complete response for their association with EFS and OS. In this responder analysis, EFS and OS were compared between patients with and without pathological complete response, irrespective of treatment assignment, with a log-rank test stratiﬁed by study. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of EFS and OS from stratiﬁed Cox regression models with study as a stratiﬁcation factor. We also obtained Kaplan-Meier estimates of EFS and OS by pathological complete response status. We assessed the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS in various subgroups. We did multivariable analyses with Cox regression models including baseline factors (age, tumour stage, nodal status, histological type, tumour grade, and tumour subtype) and pathological complete response status. We excluded patients with missing factors from the multivariable analyses.

1901 excluded 1667 assigned to adjuvant treatment (904 from ECTO; 763 from NSABP B-18) 99 in the HER2-negative treatment group of the NOAH trial 1 in the HER2-positive treatment group of the NOAH trial for whom no data obtained 134 never began assigned treatment (60 from GeparTrio; 74 from GeparQuattro) 

Outcome measures Deﬁnitions of pathological complete response varied across trials. We compared the three most commonly used pathological complete response deﬁnitions to establish their association with long-term outcome: ypT0 ypN0 (ie, absence of invasive cancer and in-situ cancer in the breast and axillary nodes), ypT0/is ypN0 (ie, absence of invasive cancer in the breast and axillary nodes, irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ), and ypT0/is (ie, absence of invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement). All trials had standard operating procedures for pathological complete response assessments. The endpoint of choice for adjuvant trials has been disease-free survival, reﬂecting the fact that patients are disease free at the time of randomisation. By contrast, EFS is used in neoadjuvant trials because all patients are not disease free at randomisation. We calculated EFS as the interval from randomisation to the earliest

To explore the potential of pathological complete response as a surrogate endpoint for EFS or OS in a trial-level analysis, we quantiﬁed the association between treatment eﬀects on pathological complete response and EFS and OS using a weighted linear regression model on a logarithmic scale. We excluded data from patients in non-randomised groups from this analysis, because we could not estimate the treatment eﬀect size in these groups. We also excluded patients in NSABP B-27 who received additional adjuvant taxane treatment because the neoadjuvant treatment eﬀect could not be isolated. We present treatment eﬀects on EFS and OS as HRs (calculated with Cox proportional hazards models) and on pathological complete response as odds ratios (calculated with logistic regression models) within each randomised comparison. The linear regression model was weighted by sample size of each randomised comparison. Using a two-stage model to adjust for the 

estimation error of treatment eﬀect size estimates,6 we calculated the coeﬃcient of determination (R²) and the associated 95% CI to measure the correlation between pathological complete response and EFS and OS by treatment eﬀect. By convention, an HR (experimental vs control) of less than 1 denotes a favourable result for EFS and OS in the experimental group, and an odds ratio (experimental vs control) of more than 1 denotes a favourable result for pathological complete response. Thus, a strong negative correlation between log hazard ratio for EFS or OS and log odds ratio for pathological complete response would validate pathological complete response as a surrogate for long-term clinical beneﬁt. All analyses were done with SAS (version 9.2).

anthracycline-based and taxane-based regimens were done, with the exception of the NOAH16 and TECHNO22 trials, which were limited to patients with HER2positive locally advanced or inﬂammatory breast cancer. Patients in the NOAH16 trial were randomly assigned to preoperative chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab, and those in the TECHNO22 trial received trastuzumab and chemotherapy followed by 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab. In the GeparQuattro trial,11,12 patients with HER2-positive tumours received trastuzumab concomitantly with chemotherapy. Overall, 1087 (55%) of 1989 patients with HER2-positive tumours included in the pooled analysis did not receive 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab because they were treated before adjuvant trastuzumab trials were reported. All Hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative 

patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumours were supposed to receive at least 5 years of endocrine therapy. Breast cancer subtype was established by clinicopathological criteria, such as hormone-receptor status, HER2 overexpression, and histological grade as assessed by local pathologists. The Ki-67 labelling index had not been routinely assessed in the included studies. 11 955 patients were included in our pooled responder analysis (ﬁgure 1). Baseline characteristics are shown in the appendix. Median age was 49 years (IQR 43–57). 7328 patients (61%) had T2 tumours, 482 (4%) had inﬂammatory breast cancer (ie, T4d tumours), and 5487 (46%) had clinically involved lymph nodes. 3572 (30%) patients had hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer, and 1989 (17%) had HER2-positive

tumours. Tumour testing for HER2 was not necessary in the earlier trials, so information about HER2-receptor status was not available for four trials (AGO-1,7 NSABP B-18,17 NSABP B-27,19 and ECTO8). Overall median followup for EFS was 5·40 years (95% CI 5·33–5·44) and for OS was 5·37 years (5·31–5·43). Overall frequency of pathological complete response was low, and the frequency decreased with increasingly stringent deﬁnitions: 22% (95% CI 21–22) of patients achieved ypT0/is, 18% (17–19) achieved ypT0/is ypN0, and 13% (12–14) achieved ypT0 ypN0. Overall, patients who achieved a pathological complete response had longer EFS and OS than did patients with residual invasive cancer (ﬁgures 2, 3). Eradication of tumour from both the breast and axillary lymph nodes (ypT0 pN0 and ypT0/is ypN0) was better associated with improved EFS and OS than was eradication of invasive tumour from the breast alone (ypT0/is; ﬁgure 3). Associations with EFS and OS were similar for ypT0 ypN0 and ypT0/is ypN0 (ﬁgure 3). Additionally, associations were consistent when we adjusted for baseline factors using multivariable Cox models. We used the ypT0/is ypN0 deﬁnition for all subsequent analyses. As expected, frequency of pathological complete responses in patients with low-grade, hormone-receptorpositive tumours was low, and more than doubled in the high-grade hormone-receptor-positive subgroup (ﬁgure 4A). The more aggressive subtypes—triplenegative and HER2-positive tumours—had increased frequencies of pathological complete response (ﬁgure 4A). Within the HER2-positive population, pathological complete response was more common for hormone-receptor-negative tumours than for hormonereceptor-positive tumours, and with the addition of trastuzumab (ﬁgure 4A). 

The pathological complete response was positively associated with EFS (HR 0·49, 95% CI 0·33–0·71) and OS (0·43, 0·23–0·71) in the overall hormone-receptorpositive, HER2-negative population. The association between pathological complete response and long-term outcome was stronger in patients with high-grade tumours than in those with low-grade tumours (ﬁgures 4B, 5). Additionally, pathological complete response was associated with long-term outcome in the HER2-positive subgroup irrespective of hormonereceptor status (EFS: HR 0·39, 95% CI 0·31–0·50; OS: 0·34, 0·24–0·47). The strength of the association increased in the hormone-receptor-negative subgroup (EFS: 0·25, 0·18–0·34; OS: 0·19, 0·12–0·31). The most favourable outcomes after pathological complete response were recorded in patients with HER2-positive, hormonereceptor-negative tumours who received trastuzumab (EFS: 0·15, 0·09–0·27; OS: 0·08, 0·03–0·22), and in the triple-negative subgroup (ﬁgures 4B, 5). We analysed the association between the eﬀect of treatments on pathological complete response and longterm outcomes in ten randomised comparisons, excluding non-randomised neoadjuvant groups and patients given additional adjuvant taxane (ﬁgure 1). At a trial level, we recorded little association between increases in frequency of pathological complete response and the treatment’s eﬀect on EFS or OS (ﬁgure 6). The coeﬃcient of determination (R²) between improvement in pathological complete response and EFS was 0·03 (95% CI 0·00–0·25), and that between improvement in pathological complete response and OS was 0·24 (0·00–0·70). We also investigated the trial-level association between pathological complete response and long-term outcome by tumour subtype. We excluded patients with lowgrade, hormone-receptor-positive tumours because of low frequency of pathological complete response. The Overall survival

results of the analyses by breast cancer subtype were consistent with ﬁndings in the overall population: no correlation between improvement in frequency of pathological complete response and the treatment’s eﬀect on EFS or OS was recorded (appendix). 

Discussion In our pooled analysis, we recorded that eradication of tumours from both breast and lymph nodes (ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0 pathological complete response) had a stronger association with improved EFS and OS than did eradication of tumour from the breast alone (ypT0/is). The strongest association between pathological complete response and long-term outcome was in patients with aggressive breast cancer subtypes (triple negative; hormone-receptor-positive, high-grade, and HER2-negative; and HER2-positive and hormone-receptor-negative). Nevertheless, an increase in frequency of pathological complete response between treatment groups did not predict improved EFS and OS. Standardisation of the deﬁnition of pathological complete response would allow planning and interpretation of future neoadjuvant clinical trials intended to support drug approval. We propose that pathological complete response is deﬁned as either ypT0/is ypN0 or ypT0 ypN0 in future trials. However, ypT0 ypN0 is a more stringent deﬁnition and its use could lead to reduced frequencies of pathological complete response. Presence or absence of ductal carcinoma in situ did not aﬀect long-term outcome in our analysis. Additionally, a retrospective analysis24,25 of a database including more than 2000 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed that residual ductal carcinoma in situ in patients with complete eradication of the invasive cancer from the breast and lymph nodes did not adversely aﬀect survival. By contrast, a German pooled analysis26 of seven neoadjuvant trials showed that patients without ductal carcinoma in situ had longer survival than did patients with residual ductal carcinoma in situ when all invasive disease was eradicated. Several other groups have reported improved longterm outcomes in patients with pathological complete response compared with those with residual tumour at the time of surgery.17,19,23,24,26 Our pooled analysis conﬁrmed this ﬁnding in various tumour subtypes and in groups divided by other baseline characteristics. The strength of the association increased with trastuzumab treatment, which emphasises the importance of targeted therapy. The association between pathological complete response and long-term outcome was weakest for hormone-receptor-positive and low-grade tumours, and for HER2-positive and hormone-receptor-positive tumours. The German pooled analysis23,26 similarly showed that the association between pathological complete response and long-term outcome was strongest in patients with aggressive breast cancer subtypes. However, pathological complete response was not 170 

prognostic in patients with luminal A or luminal B and HER2-positive breast cancer. The diﬀerence between patient-level analyses and triallevel analyses is a common source of confusion. Patientlevel analyses, sometimes referred to as responder analyses, compare the clinical outcome of patients with and without pathological complete response, irrespective of the treatment group. These analyses are meaningful as they predict improved survival for patients who attain pathological complete response. Because these responder analyses are independent of the treatment group, they are not useful for comparisons of treatments at a trial level. The CTNeoBC pooled analysis is the ﬁrst large analysis in which primary source data has been used to assess the association between pathological complete response and EFS and OS at a trial level. We propose four potential explanations for the ﬁnding that an increase in frequency of pathological complete response between treatment groups did not predict improved EFS and OS. First, in most of the included trials, women with heterogeneous breast cancer tumour subtypes were enrolled, which would be expected to obscure the association between pathological complete response and survival if subtypes respond diﬀerently to the same treatment, or if diﬀerent absolute improvements in frequency of pathological complete response are necessary to meaningfully aﬀect long-term outcomes. Second, a neoadjuvant therapy targeted to a speciﬁc tumour subtype (trastuzumab) was used in only three trials (GeparQuattro,12 NOAH,16 and TECHNO22), and trastuzumab used as an adjunct to chemotherapy in only the NOAH study. As a result, absolute diﬀerences in the frequency of pathological complete response between chemotherapy groups in the included trials were generally low (1–11%), but were as high as 20% for the NOAH trial, comparing trastuzumab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone (ypT0/is ypN0: 35% vs 15%; odds ratio 3·04, 95% CI 1·64–5·82). Similarly, the diﬀerence in the proportion of patients achieving EFS at 5 years between treatment groups in the NOAH study was 13%, although postoperative trastuzumab in the experimental group could have partly contributed to the treatment eﬀect. Fourth, factors unrelated to primary tumour response could have had a role. In the HER2-positive subgroup, we noted that the addition of one trial with increased treatment eﬀects (NOAH) decreased the slope of the curve, suggesting a trial-level correlation between frequency of pathological complete response and long-term outcome could be identiﬁed in future trials with more homogeneous populations and incorporation of targeted therapies. Future trials of subtype-speciﬁc populations with diﬀerences in frequency of pathological complete response between treatment groups that are larger than are those in the trials we included could predict improvement in EFS or OS in early-stage breast cancer. www.thelancet.com Vol 384 July 12, 2014

The importance of individual-level association should not be overlooked; it oﬀers insight into the natural history of an individual’s disease and is thus useful to counsel patients. Trial-level association is useful to predict population treatment beneﬁts. As previously suggested,6,27 an acceptable surrogate endpoint should be correlated with outcome at both the individual and trial levels. Our pooled analysis could not establish a triallevel correlation between pathological complete response and long-term outcome. In view of the substantial improvements in survival for individual patients who attain pathological complete response, we believe that if a novel agent produces a marked absolute increase in frequency of pathological complete response compared with standard therapy alone in the intention-to-treat population, that agent could also be reasonably likely to result in long-term improvements in EFS or OS.28 In our future analyses (with genomic assays to better characterise subgroups and including additional anti-HER2 trials), we will investigate the importance of pathological complete response in deﬁned subsets and assess other promising surrogate endpoints.
