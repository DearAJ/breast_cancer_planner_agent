Skeletal eﬀects of exemestane on bone-mineral density, bone biomarkers, and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer participating in the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES): a randomised controlled study Robert E Coleman, Linda M Banks, Samia I Girgis, Lucy S Kilburn, Eduard Vrdoljak, John Fox, Simon J Cawthorn, Ashraf Patel, Claire F Snowdon, Emma Hall, Judith M Bliss, R Charles Coombes on behalf of the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) group 

Summary Background Tamoxifen preserves bone in postmenopausal women, but non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors accelerate bone loss and increase fracture risk. We aimed to study the eﬀect on bone health in a subgroup of women included in the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES), a large randomised trial that compared the switch to the steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane with continuation of tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer. 

Lancet Oncol 2007; 8: 119–27 

Methods Results were analysed from 206 evaluable patients from the IES, in which postmenopausal women with histologically conﬁrmed and completely resected unilateral breast cancer (that was oestrogen-receptor positive or of unknown status), who were disease-free after 2–3 years of treatment with tamoxifen were randomised to continue oral tamoxifen 20 mg/day or switch to oral exemestane 25 mg/day to complete a total of 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. The primary endpoint was change in bone-mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover were also analysed in this substudy, and the incidence of fractures in the entire study reported. The IES is registered on the Current Controlled Trials website http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN11883920. 

See Reﬂection and Reaction page 89 

Findings Within 6 months of switching to exemestane, BMD was lowered by 0·051 g/cm3 (2·7%; 95% CI 2·0–3·4; p<0·0001) at the lumbar spine and 0·025 g/cm3 (1·4%; 0·8–1·9; p<0·0001) at the hip compared with baseline. BMD decreases were only 1·0% (0·4–1·7; p=0·002) and 0·8% (0·3–1·4; p=0·003) in year 2 at the lumbar spine and hip, respectively. No patient with BMD in the normal range at trial entry developed osteoporosis. Bone resorption and formation markers increased at all time points in women receiving exemestane (p<0·001). With a median follow-up in all IES participants (n=4274) of 58 months, 162 (7%) and 115 (5%) patients in the exemestane and tamoxifen groups, respectively, had fractures (odds ratio 1·45 [1·13–1·87]; p=0·003). Interpretation These results indicate that the increase in survival shown previously with the IES switch strategy is achieved at the expense of some detriment to skeletal health, so the risk-beneﬁt ratio to women needs to be individually assessed. 

Introduction The routine use of tamoxifen for the adjuvant treatment of oestrogen-receptor-positive early breast cancer has been challenged by experts after the development of highly speciﬁc inhibitors of aromatase. This enzyme enables the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in peripheral tissues, the adrenal glands, and breast tumours. These agents include the reversible nonsteroidal inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole, and the steroidal inactivator exemestane. Large randomised trials have shown that all three agents are more eﬀective than tamoxifen alone at preventing breast cancer recurrence, and have fewer thromboembolic complications or gynaecological side-eﬀects, including the development of endometrial cancer.1–4 However, owing to the previously described link between residual oestrogen concentrations and fracture risk in postmenopausal women,5 profound suppression of biologically available oestrogens associated with the use of aromatase inhibitors was expected to increase the http://oncology.thelancet.com Vol 8 February 2007 

rate of bone loss and consequent fracture risk. Further bone-mineral loss leading to osteoporosis and subsequent fractures is an important health problem in postmenopausal women. By contrast, tamoxifen is known to have oestrogen agonist eﬀects on bone and typically prevents postmenopausal bone loss,6,7 and might reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures.8 Reports have conﬁrmed that non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors increase the rate of bone turnover, accelerate loss of bone as measured by bone-mineral density (BMD), and increase the incidence of fractures.1,9,10 Although exemestane also has similar inhibitory eﬀects to these drugs on the aromatisation of androgens to oestrogens, a weak but potentially important anabolic eﬀect of exemestane metabolites—which might lead to decreased bone resorption—has been shown in animal studies.11 The role of exemestane in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer has been investigated in the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES). In this study, women continuing in remission after 2–3 years of

adjuvant tamoxifen were randomised to continue tamoxifen to 5 years (standard practice), or switch to exemestane until the completion of 5 years of adjuvant treatment.3 Clear beneﬁts in terms of both disease-free survival and distant recurrence-free survival were shown, and have been conﬁrmed in subsequent updated analyses.12,13 Therefore, the therapeutic strategy of switching from tamoxifen to exemestane after 2–3 years has become an approved and widely used method of treating early postmenopausal breast cancer. In the IES, quantiﬁcation of the previously unknown eﬀects of the switch strategy on bone health was deemed a priority. In a detailed bone subprotocol, changes in BMD and bone metabolism were measured to assess this potentially important adverse eﬀect of aromatase-inhibitor use. The 24-month results of this substudy and the incidence of fractures in the main trial are presented here. 

Methods Patients and procedures 4724 postmenopausal women with histologically conﬁrmed, completely resected unilateral breast cancer that was oestrogen-receptor positive or of unknown status, who were disease-free after 2–3 years of treatment with tamoxifen, were randomly assigned in a doubleblind design to either continue oral tamoxifen 20 mg/day or switch to oral exemestane 25 mg/day to complete a total of 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Randomisation was done through the local data centre for each cooperative group or via the International Cancer Collaborative Group (ICCG) Coordinating Data Centre.

The ICCG Coordinating Data Centre prepared the randomisation scheme by computer-generated permuted blocks of eight patients, stratiﬁed according to centre. The trial identiﬁcation numbers in each block were randomly shuﬄed to avoid consecutive allocation. Priority was given to the main trial, therefore the bone subprotocol was started later than the main protocol, and was implemented in 17 of the 366 centres involved in the overall study that had access to high-quality, dedicated, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone densitometry facilities. The institutional review board or local ethics committee at each participating centre approved the subprotocol, and all patients gave written informed consent to participate. Patients taking part in the main study at the 17 centres and who were eligible for the bone substudy were invited to take part in the substudy. Eligibility criteria were: eligible for the main study;3 no evidence of osteoporosis according to lumbar spine (L1–4) and total hip BMD T scores (above –2·5 SD; ie, not osteoporotic); no current bisphosphonate treatment or use in the previous 6 months; no other selective oestrogen-receptor modulator, hormone-replacement therapy, or calcium supplements for longer than 1 month in the previous 6 months; no fragility or non-fragility fractures in the previous 6 months; long-term accurate determination of BMD by DXA technically possible; and no other disease or concomitant drug treatment with expected eﬀects on bone metabolism. BMD was measured by DXA of lumbar spine (L1–4) and the hip (total, femoral neck, and Ward’s triangle) before randomisation into the IES and at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. Further BMD measurements at the end of treatment and at 1 year and 2 years after completion are still in progress. To improve precision and provide consistency, DXA scanning procedures were standardised and the scans were monitored and centrally analysed according to the study protocol by the Central Evaluation Facility at the Department of BioSurgery and Surgical Technology, Imperial College, London, UK. Before and throughout the study, instrument qualitycontrol procedures were undertaken by the diﬀerent scanning centres, and included quality-assurance scans deﬁned in the manufacturer’s operating manual and twice-weekly scans of the manufacturer’s spine phantom. These results were reviewed on a regular basis by the Central Evaluation Facility to conﬁrm that the equipment was working within speciﬁcations and no major ﬂuctuations were occurring that might aﬀect the accuracy of the ﬁnal DXA result. Serum and urine samples were collected for analysis of biochemical markers of bone turnover on two occasions before randomisation to provide a reliable baseline assessment and at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 on study treatment. The bone markers assessed were the resorption markers urinary N-telopeptide (NTX), deoxypyridinoline, and serum C-terminal cross-linked http://oncology.thelancet.com Vol 8 February 2007

telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX); and the formation markers serum bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and C-terminal procollagen peptide fragment (PICP). All markers were measured at the Francis Fraser Laboratory (Clinical Pathology Accreditation [UK] Ltd certiﬁed) at the Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK, under the supervision of one investigator (SIG), and internal quality-control samples of high, medium, and low concentrations were processed with each batch of serum samples. Serum was taken, whenever possible, in the fasting state, and at a similar time of day to minimise diurnal and diet-related eﬀects on bone markers. The second voided urine of the day was collected for measurements of urinary markers, and the results were expressed as a ratio to urinary creatinine concentration. Bone markers were measured by ELISA. The coeﬃcients of variation within and between assays were less than 8·4% for all markers. Fracture incidence was recorded throughout the study, and spinal fractures were assessed by the Central Evaluation Facility on lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs taken locally with central assessment before randomisation, at the end of treatment, and 2 years after the end of treatment. In the IES, fractures were reported on a case report form at each follow-up. However, routine radiographs of the spine were not done in the main study and, therefore, asymptomatic spinal fractures were typically not identiﬁed. Each person is counted once in an incident case analysis, with their worse graded event over follow-up being the one that is counted. Since the safety data was Medical Dictionary for Regulatories Activities (MedDRA) coded, the fracture MedDRA codes were combined to create an overall group. Each person was counted once (even, for example, when the patient has had a hip and spine fracture at diﬀerent times during follow-up) and also where each MedDRA code was considered separately, so the number reporting hip, spine, wrist and other are not exclusive. The primary endpoint of the substudy was mean annual change from baseline in lumbar spine and total hip BMD

in patients who remained on tamoxifen, compared with that in participants who switched to exemestane. Secondary endpoints included changes in markers of bone turnover between the two treatment groups at each timepoint, within-group changes in BMD and bone markers, and assessment of the links between changes in biochemical markers of bone metabolism and changes in BMD. The incidences of fractures in the IES treatment groups were also assessed. 

Statistical analysis The sample size for this substudy was based on predicted diﬀerences in BMD from studies of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women.14 172 participants were needed to detect a conservative estimated 2% diﬀerence in BMD (SD 4) between treatment groups at 24 months, with 90% power and a two-sided signiﬁcance level of 0·05. The planned participant number was rounded up to 200 participants to allow for dropouts. The study has 89% power based on the number of patients who completed the study and 87% for the number of patients with BMD results available at 24 months. Analyses were done on all cleaned data processed by the Central Evaluation Facility available on Nov 8, 2005, by use of Stata (version 8.2). The primary analysis was

based on treatment actually received for all treated patients, with data within predeﬁned visit windows of 1 month before or after the follow-up date for the visits at months 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18, and within 1 month before or 2 months after the 24-month window to incorporate eligible end-of-treatment visits. Before analysis, a pragmatic deﬁnition of when study participants should be censored was established. It included completion of study treatment, the start of any bisphosphonate treatment, and the date of relapse—unless the relapse was a skeletal metastasis, in which case, to minimise confounding eﬀects of bone metastasis on BMD and bone metabolism, patients were censored at a last visit that was at least 3 months before the relapse date.

unless otherwise stated. Values after censoring are treated as missing in subsequent analyses. Sensitivity analyses at all time points were done to conﬁrm the robustness of the primary analysis and included the intention-to-treat population, randomised treatment, and patients with complete follow-up. BMD changes at all sites were expressed as percentage changes from baseline and compared by use of twosample (between-treatment groups) and paired (within groups) t tests. Data for the lumbar spine and total hip are reported, but speciﬁc measurements for the femoral neck and Ward’s triangle BMD are not shown. Absolute changes in T scores were also considered (data not shown). Because bone markers were not normally distributed, data are given as median (IQR). The Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon sign rank non-parametric tests were used to compare percentage change from baseline. Absolute values of the bone markers are shown to allow for the eﬀects of 2–3 years of previous treatment with tamoxifen, and to enable comparisons with other trials. To account for the longitudinal nature of the data, we took a repeated-measures approach using generalised http://oncology.thelancet.com Vol 8 February 2007

estimating equations. For these data, an unstructured correlation matrix was assumed. The independent variable was absolute BMD at each time point as a continuous variable. Dependent variables were treatment received, baseline absolute BMD, month of visit (3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24), and prespeciﬁed covariates of age (<60 years, 60–70 years, >70 years) and weight (<70 kg, 70–80 kg, >80 kg). Interactions between covariates and also polynomial eﬀects were considered. None signiﬁcantly improved the ﬁt of the models. Also, diﬀerent correlation structures, such as exchangeable, were used to conﬁrm the models’ robustness, along with modelling of the data without the prespeciﬁed covariates. Neither of these sensitivity checks aﬀected the results. For simplicity, and to aid clinical interpretation, t tests and change from baseline are shown rather than the more statistically powerful but complex longitudinal repeated-measures model. Fractures were recorded for all patients as adverse events in the main study. To identify the adverse risk associated with these events, they were analysed for a safety population as deﬁned in the main study that included patients according to treatment received, censoring at time of relapse (or 3 months before if the relapse was a skeletal metastasis). Analyses restricted to time on endocrine treatment and all available follow-up (on treatment plus post-treatment follow-up) were done. Incidence rates were analysed by treatment group, per 1000 women-years, and allowed in every case for one fracture per patient and several fractures per patient over all available follow-up. An analysis was done of time to ﬁrst recorded fracture by use of a Cox proportional hazards model that adjusted for age (<60 years, 60–70 years, >70 years) and country fracture risk (deﬁned as average risk of osteoporotic hip fracture for a country compared with a reference country with a very high risk; very high, high, medium, low).15 As in the main study, and to account for multiple testing of adverse events, p<0·01 was taken as signiﬁcant for the fracture data. However, to allow comparison with other trials, 95% CI are quoted here. This study is registered with ISRCTN number 11883920. 

Role of the funding source The pharmaceutical sponsor Pﬁzer is the parent company of Pharmacia who provided some of the treatments, gave organisational and monitoring support to the Central Evaluation Facility, and was represented on the trial steering committee; the committee was made up of at least two representatives from each of the 20 collaborative groups (local clinical study representative and the senior data manager or statistician), representatives from the Coordinating Data Centre, including the trial manager and study statisticians, and three from the pharmaceutical sponsor. The corresponding author directed all analyses, had full access to all the data in the study, and had ﬁnal responsibility for the decision to submit the report for publication. http://oncology.thelancet.com Vol 8 February 2007 

Results Between April, 2000, and February, 2003, 206 patients (101 assigned exemestane and 105 tamoxifen) from 17 centres were entered into the bone substudy (ﬁgure 1). The randomised groups were well balanced in terms of demographics and treatments received before randomisation. At baseline, BMD, T score, and the proportion of osteopenic patients or levels of bone markers did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between the groups (tables 1 and 2). 95 patients were osteopenic at baseline (WHO criteria for osteopenia is T score <–1·0 and >–2·5), 49 in the exemestane group and 46 in the tamoxifen group. 74 patients in the exemestane group and 82 in the tamoxifen group had BMA data at 24 months (ﬁgure 1). Figure 2 shows the percentage changes from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip for each visit. The data are approximately normally distributed. No statistically signiﬁcant within-group changes in BMD were seen with continuation of tamoxifen. However, BMD rapidly decreased from baseline in the ﬁrst 6 months after switching from tamoxifen to exemestane by 0·051 g/cm3 (2·7%; 95% CI 2·0–3·4; p<0·0001) at the lumbar spine and 0·025 g/cm3 (1·4%; 0·8–1·9; p<0·0001) at the total hip. Thereafter the decline in BMD progressively slowed in months 6–12 and 12–24, but continued to decline (ﬁgure 2). Reductions in BMD were only 1·0% (0·39–1·70; p=0·002) and 0·8% (0·29–1·39; p=0·003) in year 2 at the lumbar spine and hip, respectively, between 12 and 24 months. The diﬀerences in mean BMD, with 95% CI between the treatment groups at each time point (ﬁgure 3) again show the rapid changes in BMD in the ﬁrst 6 months after switching from tamoxifen. These ﬁndings are consistent with the point estimates and statistical precision provided by the Exemestane (n=2320)

Figure 4: Median (IQR) changes in bone resorption and formation markers 

generalised estimating equation approach used to model the longitudinal data (data not shown). The numbers and types of fractures during follow-up are shown in table 3. The decline in BMD after the switch to exemestane resulted in a greater incidence of osteopenia at 24 months, and ﬁve patients—who were osteopenic at baseline— developed osteoporosis (table 4). The changes in bone markers from baseline (absolute and percentage changes) were statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between treatments at all time points (ﬁgure 4). Bone resorption and formation marker measurements remained fairly constant over time in the tamoxifen group. Withdrawal of tamoxifen associated with the start 124 

of exemestane increased the rate of bone turnover. The greatest changes were recorded during the ﬁrst 6 months. In the exemestane group, resorption marker measurements were highest at 12 months, and then decreased—but remained higher than that of the tamoxifen group at 24 months—while bone formation markers peaked between 18 and 24 months. The proportion of patients who had concentrations of bone markers within the normal ranges at baseline and went on to have values outside the normal range was signiﬁcantly higher in the exemestane group than in the tamoxifen group; for example, 81 (82%) of patients assigned exemestane had increases in the bone resorption http://oncology.thelancet.com Vol 8 February 2007

marker deoxypyridinoline versus 50 (49%) of those receiving tamoxifen (p<0·001), and increases in the formation marker bone alkaline phosphatase were recorded in 81 (82%) and 38 (37%) of patients assigned exemestane and tamoxifen, respectively (p<0·001). Similar changes were recorded for the other bone resorption and formation markers assessed. Generally, there were signiﬁcant negative correlations between bone-marker and BMD changes. Signiﬁcant, albeit weak, correlations between bone-marker and BMD changes at 24 months (r=–0·172 to –0·343) compared with those at baseline were recorded for all bone markers, with the exception of PICP for the spine, and PICP and deoxypyridinoline for the hip. In the main study, which had a median follow-up in all participants of 58 months (range 0–89·7) and median exposure to exemestane of 30 months (IQR 24·4–34·3), 162 (7%) of patients in the exemestane group had fractures compared with 115 (5%) patients in the tamoxifen group (odds ratio 1·45 [1·13–1·87]; p=0·003, by safety analysis); 84 (4%) and 64 (3%; 1·33 [0·95–1·89]; p=0·086) of these patients had these fractures before the follow-up visit at 24 months. The incidences of multiple fractures per 1000 women-years of observation (safety analysis and all events) were 19 (17–22) and 15 (13–18) for the exemestane and tamoxifen groups, respectively (table 5). Although age and country fracture risk15 aﬀected fracture risk in univariate testing, a Cox proportional hazards analysis that took into account time to ﬁrst fracture and adjusted for these factors did not signiﬁcantly change the risk of fracture according to treatment group (data not shown). The number of fractures over 24 months was low, and no conclusions on relation to BMD or bone-marker changes can be made. Nine (4%) fractures occurred in total, of which three (1%) were traumatic and six (3%) were due to fragility (three in each treatment group). 

Discussion We investigated the possible eﬀects on bone health of the steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane, coupled with previous treatment with tamoxifen compared with the eﬀects of remaining on tamoxifen. We postulated that pretreatment with tamoxifen, coupled with the possible anabolic eﬀects of exemestane, would lead to fewer adverse eﬀects on bone than have been reported for treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor alone. Although signiﬁcant changes in bone markers and BMD were http://oncology.thelancet.com Vol 8 February 2007 

recorded within 6 months of tamoxifen withdrawal and exemestane initiation, these are due, at least partly, to the cessation of bone-turnover suppression induced by tamoxifen. The percentage median rates of lumbar spine bone loss for this group in the IES were –2·9%, –3·6%, and –4·0% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. In the MA-17 study of extended adjuvant therapy with letrozole versus placebo after 5 years of tamoxifen treatment, a 3% decline in lumbar spine BMD after 12 months was measured in the placebo group on withdrawal of tamoxifen, followed by recovery to +1% at 24 months.16 The BMDs in the population treated with letrozole were –2·9% at 12 months and –5·4% at 24 months. We have not encountered a patient with normal baseline BMD (T score >–1) who developed osteoporosis. Although our sample size is quite small, such an event would be highly unlikely because bone loss of more than 12–15% would be necessary for transition from a healthy to osteoporotic state—a degree of change that was not seen in any patient. Even with 5 years of treatment with anastrozole, osteoporosis in a patient with baseline BMD has not been reported.17 Another study that investigated the skeletal eﬀects of exemestane is a placebo-controlled trial in 128 Scandinavian women who had very low-risk breast cancer.18 In that study, the annual reduction in spinal BMD did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between women assigned exemestane and those assigned placebo (2·2% vs 1·8%; p=NS). However, annual changes in hip BMD did diﬀer between the two treatment groups (2·7% vs 1·5%; p=0·024). The changes in the placebo group were greater than might be expected, perhaps due to previously unrecognised vitamin D deﬁciency in this Nordic population.19 The diﬀerences between the two groups were generally similar to those recorded in the second year of the IES bone study, once the eﬀects of tamoxifen withdrawal had waned. In studies reported to date, fracture rates with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors have been consistently higher than with tamoxifen. In the ATAC study1—which had a median follow-up of 68 months—the incidence of fractures was 340 (11%) with anastrazole compared with only 237 (8%) with tamoxifen (odds ratio 1·49 [95% CI 1·25–1·77]; p<0·0001). Similarly, in the BIG 1-98 study 2 (median follow-up 36 months), the fracture rate with letrozole (211; 9%) was about 40% higher than that with tamoxifen (141; 6%).20 In the IES, the incidence of fractures increased numerically during exemestane 125

treatment (median duration 30 months) and became signiﬁcant (7% vs 5%; p≤0·01) when all events were counted during both the treatment and follow-up periods (median duration 58 months). A Cox proportional hazards analysis showed a hazard ratio of 1·27 (1·03–1·58) in the hazard for fracture in all analyses, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of bodyweight, country of residence, or age on the risk of fractures (data not shown). The incidence of fractures in the exemestane group was 19·2 per 1000 women-years. In the ATAC and BIG 1-98 trials, the annual fracture incidences in women receiving anastrozole or letrozole were slightly higher at 21·6 and 22·0 per 1000 women-years, respectively. Correspondingly, the fracture incidence per 1000 womenyears with tamoxifen alone in the IES (15) was similar to that reported for women randomly assigned tamoxifen in the ATAC (13) or BIG 1-98 (15) trials.2,17 The diﬀerence in fracture incidence between the two treatment groups in IES was of similar magnitude to the 1·29 hazard ratio with tamoxifen compared with placebo in women aged over 50 years reported in the P1 breast cancer prevention study.8 These observations suggest that the excess fracture incidence associated with exemestane is related as much to the absence of tamoxifen as to the use of exemestane. In this study, we assessed bone markers of resorption and formation. Assessment of the marker changes is confounded by previous treatment with tamoxifen, which caused a reduction in bone turnover. The changes in bone markers in the ATAC trial suggest that bone resorption and formation at the time of randomisation 126 

were probably suppressed by about 30% and 15%, respectively, compared with an untreated population.21 Therefore, assessment of percentage changes in bone markers in the IES gives a falsely high impression of the eﬀects of exemestane on bone turnover. In terms of absolute values, the changes in bone markers were modest, with eﬀects on bone resorption reaching a maximum within the ﬁrst 6 months. Because of the expected coupling of osteoclast and osteoblast function, the increases in bone formation markers continued for 12 months, but remained constant thereafter. The IES has shown an advantage in terms of preventing breast cancer recurrence for the switch to exemestane after 2–3 years of tamoxifen compared with continuing tamoxifen.13 The bone subprotocol results reported here indicate that this advantage is achieved at the expense of some detriment to skeletal health (4·0% bone loss at the lumbar spine after 2 years with exemestane vs 0·6% with tamoxifen). Figure 5 summarises the lumbar-spine BMD results from this study superimposed on the expected BMD increase with 2–3 years of previous treatment with tamoxifen and the BMD data from the ATAC and MA-17 bone subprotocols. Although this is a comparison of diﬀerent datasets, the probable eﬀect of the diﬀerent aromatase inhibitor treatments on bone health can be estimated. The overall 5-year eﬀects on BMD of 2–3 years of treatment with tamoxifen followed by exemestane for 2–3 years are modest, but the rates of demineralisation on exemestane, letrozole, and anastrazole seem to be comparable during the ﬁrst 2 years of treatment. We recommend that in monitoring of patients receiving tamoxifen followed by exemestane, a BMD assessment in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations should be done around the time of switching treatment.22 Patients with BMD in the normal range at this time do not need further BMD assessment, but should be given lifestyle advice on preservation of bone health and encouraged to take adequate calcium and vitamin D through the diet or supplements. Those with osteopenia should have BMD measurements every 1–2 years, lifestyle advice, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and therapeutic intervention with a bisphosphonate as appropriate. Patients with pre-existing osteoporosis should also receive bisphosphonate treatment. However, no data exist on BMD changes in patients with pre-existing osteoporosis for any of the aromatase inhibitors. An assumption is made that bisphosphonates will be eﬀective treatment for osteoporosis in the presence of an aromatase inhibitor, but speciﬁc data in this subgroup of women are needed before precise recommendations can be made. In conclusion, these results indicate that the IES switch strategy of replacing tamoxifen after 2–3 years with exemestane for a further 2–3 years leads to reversal of the protective eﬀect of tamoxifen on bone. http://oncology.thelancet.com Vol 8 February 2007
