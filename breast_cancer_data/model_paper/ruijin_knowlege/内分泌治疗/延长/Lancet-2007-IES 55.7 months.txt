Summary Background Early improvements in disease-free survival have been noted when an aromatase inhibitor is given either instead of or sequentially after tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor-positive early breast cancer. However, little information exists on the long-term eﬀects of aromatase inhibitors after treatment, and whether these early improvements lead to real gains in survival. Methods 4724 postmenopausal patients with unilateral invasive, oestrogen-receptor-positive or oestrogen-receptorunknown breast cancer who were disease-free on 2–3 years of tamoxifen, were randomly assigned to switch to exemestane (n=2352) or to continue tamoxifen (n=2372) for the remainder of a 5-year endocrine treatment period. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival; overall survival was a secondary endpoint. Eﬃcacy analyses were intention-to-treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN11883920. Results After a median follow-up of 55·7 months (range 0–89·7), 809 events contributing to the analysis of diseasefree survival had been reported (354 exemestane, 455 tamoxifen); unadjusted hazard ratio 0·76 (95% CI 0·66–0·88, p=0·0001) in favour of exemestane, absolute beneﬁt 3·3% (95% CI 1·6–4·9) by end of treatment (ie, 2·5 years after randomisation). 222 deaths occurred in the exemestane group compared with 261 deaths in the tamoxifen group; unadjusted hazard ratio 0·85 (95% CI 0·71–1·02, p=0·08), 0·83 (0·69–1·00, p=0·05) when 122 patients with oestrogen-receptor-negative disease were excluded. Conclusions Our results suggest that early improvements in disease-free survival noted in patients who switch to exemestane after 2–3 years on tamoxifen persist after treatment, and translate into a modest improvement in overall survival. 

Introduction For many years tamoxifen was recognised as the standard adjuvant endocrine treatment for oestrogen-receptorpositive breast cancer. In women with oestrogen-receptorpositive (or oestrogen-receptor-unknown) disease, 5 years of treatment with tamoxifen after deﬁnitive surgery was shown to reduce the annual recurrence rate by 41% and breast cancer mortality by 34%, translating into an absolute reduction of 9·2% in patients dying from breast cancer by 15 years.1 In addition to beneﬁt noted while patients are on treatment, further gain is seen during the 5 years after treatment. Aromatase is the key enzyme responsible for oestrogen biosynthesis; aromatase inhibitors have been in use for three decades. Third-generation aromatase inhibitors (letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane) are eﬀective in postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer resistant to tamoxifen.2–5 Large randomised trials have reported early improvements in disease-free survival during treatment with an aromatase inhibitor compared with tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting. Clinical applications have included upfront monotherapy with an www.thelancet.com Vol 369 February 17, 2007 

aromatase inhibitor,6,7 a switch to an aromatase inhibitor after 2–3 years of tamoxifen,8–10 and a comparison with placebo in the extended adjuvant setting.11,12 Importantly, this beneﬁt is accompanied by a reduction in the commonly recognised side-eﬀects of tamoxifen. However, concern has been raised about the eﬀects of aromatase inhibitors on other aspects of safety, including eﬀects on bone loss and the cardiovascular system. The Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) was designed to ascertain whether switching to exemestane, a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, after 2–3 years of tamoxifen could improve disease outcome compared with continuing tamoxifen for the remainder of the 5-year treatment period. We postulated that use of both treatments in sequence would improve eﬃcacy and reduce side-eﬀects compared with use of either treatment alone, since carry-over from early exposure to tamoxifen would provide continuing disease-related beneﬁts and, through its oestrogenic eﬀects, ameliorate some of the adverse eﬀects of aromatase inhibitors, such as excess calcium loss. Further, we reasoned that switching might reduce the tamoxifen-associated incidence of thromboembolism and endometrial cancer.

Early release of the results of IES, on the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), was prompted by a signiﬁcant early improvement in disease-free survival, which exceeded the predeﬁned statistical stopping boundary.8 At the time of publication more than 90% of patients had completed allocated treatment, so that dissemination of results was unlikely to contaminate the trial.13 With a median follow-up of 30·6 months, 449 disease-free survival events, and 199 deaths, switching to exemestane reduced the risk of events contributing to the analysis of disease-free survival by 32% but at this early time point, overall survival did not diﬀer between the treatment groups. In this analysis, with a median follow-up of almost 5 years and more than 10 000 women-years of post-treatment information, we investigated whether early disease-related beneﬁts persisted after treatment and whether any long-term adverse risks had emerged. 

Methods Study design IES was an international, intercooperative group, phase III trial in postmenopausal women previously diagnosed with oestrogen-receptor-positive or oestrogen-receptorunknown breast cancer who received adequate local and adjuvant systemic treatments including tamoxifen (and chemotherapy if indicated). Women who remained free of disease on tamoxifen after 2–3 years were randomised to switch to exemestane (25 mg daily) or to continue tamoxifen (20 mg or 30 mg [Denmark] per day) for the 

remainder of the 5-year endocrine treatment period. The study design, eligibility criteria, treatment schedules, and statistical analysis plan have been previously described.8 Site monitoring was done by representatives of Pﬁzer or by the co-operative groups. All data was sent to the coordinating data centre where it was entered centrally onto the clinical database. All statistical analyses were done within the coordinating data centre. Adverse events were graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria grades (December, 1994, revised version) and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 5.1). Serious cardiovascular events were reviewed by an independent cardiologist who also deﬁned higher level cardiovascular groupings to facilitate comparison with other studies. All second primary cancers were reviewed to ascertain any potential confusion with metastatic breast cancer. For such cases, histological and where relevant, radiological reports underwent a double central review by investigators (RCC and ASC) blind to allocated treatment. This analysis includes all data processed by the coordinating data centre by Feb 27, 2006. 

Statistical analysis After publication of IES, advice was sought from the trial’s IDMC and steering committee to deﬁne the criteria required to trigger an updated analysis. The following procedure was agreed: to undertake an updated analysis when 95% of patients had had at least 3 years follow-up or had died during the corresponding period, and to do a supplementary analysis (in addition to the protocol-deﬁned

intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis), excluding patients subsequently found to have had oestrogen-receptornegative disease. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, with events contributing to the analysis deﬁned as local and distant breast cancer recurrence, new primary breast cancer (ipsilateral or contralateral) and death without disease relapse (intercurrent death). Secondary endpoints included overall survival and incidence of contralateral breast cancer. For comparison with other studies, breastcancer-free survival (censoring intercurrent deaths of known cause) and time to distant recurrence (distant recurrence, deaths from breast cancer, deaths with unknown cause with no metastases reported) were also analysed. Breast cancer deaths constituted all those with conﬁrmed cause of breast cancer, cause unknown or death from any cause following a breast cancer relapse. We analysed survival endpoints using log-rank tests, Kaplan Meier plots, Nelson Aalen cumulative hazard plots, and Cox proportional hazards models with and without adjusting for pre-speciﬁed prognostic factors of oestrogen-receptor status, nodal status, use of chemotherapy, and use of hormone replacement therapy. The proportionality assumption of the Cox model was tested with Schoenfeld residuals and was found to hold. Absolute diﬀerences in survival at 2·5 years after randomisation (roughly equivalent to 5 years post-diagnosis and coinciding with end of treatment for most patients) and at 5 years after randomisation are also reported.14 All eﬃcacy analyses were ITT and the pre-deﬁned oestrogen-receptor-positive or oestrogen-receptor-unknown groups. Additional analyses were done with the survival times divided into the periods on-treatment (0–2·5 years) and post-treatment (2·5 years onwards). The criterion for statistical signiﬁcance for eﬃcacy analyses was set at α=0·05 (two-sided). No adjustment was made for multiple testing in these analyses. Analyses of adverse events were done according to actual treatment received and worst adverse event grade reported after randomisation. A sensitivity analysis using the intention-to-treat group produced results very similar to those reported (data not shown). On-treatment analysis included adverse events occurring between randomisation and 30 days after last study treatment, censoring patients at time of relapse or second primary cancer. A second safety analysis extended the at-risk time period, including both on-treatment and post-treatment adverse events (again censoring at relapse or second primary cancer). For all safety analyses the criterion for statistical signiﬁcance was set at α=0·01 because of the large number of statistical tests (with corresponding 99% CIs presented). Adverse events have been presented in two complementary formats: all MedDRA coded adverse events satisfying predeﬁned criteria (ie, ≥10% incidence, p<0·01 or >1% diﬀerence in incidence between treatment arms); and graphical illustration of the odds ratio (OR) of adverse events types www.thelancet.com Vol 369 February 17, 2007

opportunity to critically review the manuscript; however editorial control was retained by the members of the steering committee independent of the sponsor. The sponsor was represented in a minority on the trial’s steering committee. All analyses were done by the coordinating data centre in agreement with the trial’s IDMC and steering committee. The corresponding author had access to all study data and took ﬁnal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 

Results 4724 patients with evaluable data were randomised from 37 countries and 366 sites between 1998 and 2003. With a median follow-up of 55·7 months (range 0–89·7) the present analysis provides 10 456 women-years of ontreatment data (5162 exemestane and 5294 tamoxifen) and 10 335 women-years of post-treatment follow-up. More than 95% of patients had at least 3 years of follow-up or had died during the corresponding period. Figure 1 shows the trial proﬁle and table 1 shows patients’ characteristics. Since randomisation, previously unknown oestrogen status has been ascertained in 381 patients. 122 patients were identiﬁed as having had oestrogen-negative tumours. Table 2 shows the numbers of patients with disease-free survival events and numbers of deaths. Of the 809 diseasefree survival events so far reported, 354 were in patients allocated to switch to exemestane and 455 in patients allocated to remain on tamoxifen. Overall in the ITT group, the unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for disease-free survival was 0·76 (95% CI 0·66–0·88; p=0·0001) in favour of exemestane (ﬁgure 2). In the oestrogen-receptor-positive and oestrogen-receptor-unknown group, very similar results were obtained, with a HR of 0·75 (95% CI 0·65–0·87; p=0·0001). In the ITT group, this HR translated into a 3·3% (95% CI 1·6–4·9) absolute improvement in disease-free survival at 2·5 years after randomisation, and a 3·4% (0·1–6·8) improvement 5 years after randomisation. For the oestrogen-receptor-positive and oestrogen-receptorunknown group, the absolute improvement at 2·5 years was 3·5% (95% CI 1·8–5·1) and at 5 years was 3·5% (0·1–6·9). Figure 3 shows a lower annual hazard rate during the on-treatment period in patients who switch to exemestane than in those who stay on tamoxifen; early divergence of the cumulative hazard rates was maintained throughout the post-treatment period. By partitioning the survival time, a HR of 0·65 (95% CI 0·53–0·80) was noted for the on-treatment (0–2·5 years) period, with potential further gain, but no material loss seen post-treatment (HR 0·86; 95% CI 0·71–1·05). Adjusting for potential confounders did not substantially aﬀect the estimates of treatment eﬀect, and the size of beneﬁt for switching to exemestane seemed consistent across subgroups (ﬁgure 4). Breast-cancer-free survival, time to distant recurrence, and time to contralateral breast cancer were all improved by switching to exemestane (table 3) for the ITT group and the oestrogen-receptor-positive or oestrogen-receptorunknown group. www.thelancet.com Vol 369 February 17, 2007

At a median follow-up time of almost 5 years, about 10% of patients had died (table 2). Of the 483 deaths reported, 222 occurred in patients allocated exemestane and 261 in those allocated tamoxifen. 317 deaths had known breast-cancer cause or followed a breast-cancer relapse (151 exemestane, 166 tamoxifen), with an additional ITT group HR (95% CI)

23 patients (eight exemestane, 15 tamoxifen) dying of unknown cause and considered likely to be deaths due to breast cancer. Fewer deaths due to cancers other than breast cancer occurred in the exemestane group than in the tamoxifen group. Numbers of deaths due to vascular and cardiac causes were infrequent in both treatment groups. In the ITT analysis, 222 deaths occurred in the exemestane group and 261 in the tamoxifen group (15% relative reduction in risk of death, 95% CI consistent with 29% reduction to 2% increase, p=0·08; ﬁgures 5 and 6). When 122 patients with oestrogen-receptor-negative disease were excluded, 210 patients died in the exemestane group compared with 251 in the tamoxifen group (17% relative reduction, 95% CI consistent with 31% reduction to no change, p=0·05; ﬁgures 5 and 6). The divergence between curves emerged within 2 years and persisted throughout the post-treatment period. Again, beneﬁt was consistent across subgroups, although precision was limited by the relatively small numbers of events (ﬁgure 7). 564 

Adjusting for potential confounders gave results very similar to the unadjusted results (ITT analysis: HR 0·85, 95% CI 0·71–1·01); p=0·07; oestrogen-receptor-positive and oestrogen-receptor-unknown group: 0·83, 0·69–0·99; p=0·04). 4658 (99·6%) patients received some study treatment; 2146 (92.5%) of those taking exemestane reported an adverse event of any grade, compared with 2165 (92·6%) on tamoxifen. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were noted in 426 (18·4%) patients on exemestane and 411 (17·6%) on tamoxifen. Table 4 shows the on-treatment safety analysis and table 5 includes adverse events that occurred during treatment and post-treatment. Forest plots showing symptoms of most clinical interest are shown in ﬁgure 8. Patients who received exemestane reported fewer venous thromboembolic events on treatment than did those on tamoxifen (table 4). The incidence of cardiovascular events (excluding venous thromboembolic events) did not seem to diﬀer between the groups while on treatment or when www.thelancet.com Vol 369 February 17, 2007 

Articles 

post-treatment events were included (tables 4 and 5). No other statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in reported cardiovascular events were noted either on-treatment or including the post-treatment period. Myocardial infarctions were rare and occurred in 31 (1·3%) exemestane-treated patients compared with 19 (0·8%) tamoxifen-treated patients (p=0·08). Any eﬀect of treatment on risk of myocardial infarction seemed largely restricted to patients with a history of hypertension; 22 (71·1%) of patients on exemestane who had a myocardial infarction had hypertension at baseline, compared with six (31·6%) of the corresponding patients on tamoxifen. The number of sudden deaths was very low, with three (two cardiac, one unknown cause) in the exemestane and two (one cardiac, one unknown cause) in the tamoxifen group. Musculoskeletal pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, joint stiﬀness, paraesthesia, and arthralgia were reported more frequently and cramp less frequently in patients who switched to exemestane than in those who remained on tamoxifen. These eﬀects emerged during the on-treatment period. In total, fractures occurred in 277 patients (table 5). Hip, spine, and wrist fracture rates were few. Including on-treatment and post-treatment follow-up, other types of fractures were more common in patients who switched to exemestane than in those on tamoxifen. Rates of fracture per 1000 women-years (allowing for more than one fracture per patient) were 19·2 (99% CI 15·9–23·1) for exemestane and 15·1 (12·2–18·7) for tamoxifen. Fewer clinically serious gynaecological events were reported in patients who switched to exemestane than in those on tamoxifen in the on-treatment period and throughout follow-up (tables 4 and 5). The number of gynaecological operations done in each treatment group was low and diﬀerences in rates of hysterectomy were not statistically signiﬁcant. Overall, fewer patients taking exemestane developed uterine polyps or ﬁbroids (odds ratio 0·34, 99% CI 0·19–0·58) or had a dilatation and curettage compared with tamoxifen (0·45, 99% CI 0·19–0·98). Numbers of endometrial cancers did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between the groups. 

Discussion This updated analysis of IES lends support to the rationale for switching adjuvant therapy to exemestane after 2–3 years of tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients who remain free of recurrence after treatment for early breast cancer. The parallel nature of the disease-free survival curves after treatment is consistent with the notion of a carry-over eﬀect for the tamoxifen-exemestane switch strategy, similar in size to that seen with tamoxifen alone. We observed no evidence that the early disease-related beneﬁts of the switch strategy are lost once treatment has ceased, but little additional relative gain was noted. The hypothesis that an early improvement in disease-free survival would lead to improved overall survival seems to be correct. Despite the good prognosis and age of this population, our results suggest a modest reduction in the www.thelancet.com Vol 369 February 17, 2007

risk of death, with divergence of the risk seen 1–2 years after randomisation and persisting thereafter. In addition to the ITT analysis, we did a supplementary analysis in which we omitted patients subsequently conﬁrmed to have had oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours. On completion of recruitment, 935 (20%) patients had been entered with unknown oestrogen-receptor status; the steering committee expressed interest in ascertaining oestrogen-receptor status in as many of these patients as possible. The supplementary analysis excluded the small group of patients (n=122) subsequently conﬁrmed to have had oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours (irrespective of progesterone-receptor status), who thus would not have satisﬁed the trial’s eligibility criteria and who would be unlikely to beneﬁt from endocrine therapy.1 The analysis strategy was agreed prospectively by the trial’s IDMC 565

Criteria for inclusion of adverse events in table: toxic eﬀects that had >1% point diﬀerence between the two treatment groups, ≥10% incidence in either treatment group, or a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two treatment groups (p<0·01). This safety population included on-treatment events for all treated patients, censoring at relapse or second primary cancer. Denominator for uterine-related symptoms excluded patients who had a hysterectomy before randomisation: n=1982 for exemestane and n=2008 for tamoxifen treatment group. Some deaths of unknown cause were classiﬁed (by RB) conservatively as cardiac deaths for the safety analysis. CV=cardiovascular. UG=ungraded (classed as between grades 2 and 3). DC=dilatation and curettage. 

Table 4: Numbers of toxic eﬀects reported on-treatment, by Common Toxicity Criteria grade 

and steering committee, as was the decision to retain patients in the analysis for whom it was not possible to ascertain oestrogen-receptor status. Although other trials that recruited a substantial number of patients with unknown oestrogen-receptor status have reported results for the speciﬁc oestrogen-receptor-positive subgroup,6 our preference was to exclude patients conﬁrmed to have had oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours for the reasons outlined above. The retention in the analysis of patients with continued unknown receptor status, where the majority can be expected to 566 

have oestrogen-receptor-positive cancers, maximises the statistical power of the study. The ﬁndings of IES are consistent with those of the ABCSG-8, ARNO-95, and ITA trials,9,10 which also assessed a switching strategy, in this case to anastrozole. A metaanalysis of the results of these trials, excluding ineligible patients, conﬁrmed early disease-related beneﬁts associated with a switching strategy.15 With a median follow-up of 30 months, beneﬁts have been reported for disease-free survival (HR=0·59, 95% CI 0·48–0·74; p<0·001) and overall survival (0·71, 0·52–0·98; p=0·038), giving eﬀect www.thelancet.com Vol 369 February 17, 2007

For many patients, however, post-treatment follow-up was short; hence, as in our previous publication,8 the results are dominated by the on-treatment period. Results of studies with initial monotherapy with an aromatase inhibitor, such as ATAC (anastrozole) and BIG 1-98 (letrozole), showed early disease-related and safety beneﬁts on treatment,6,7,16 but in the ATAC study, with a median follow-up of 68 months, evidence of an improvement in overall survival www.thelancet.com Vol 369 February 17, 2007 

was not noted (HR=0·97, 95%CI 0·85–1·12); p=0·70), however, only 60% of all deaths were due to breast cancer. In BIG1-98, with a median follow-up of 51 months, fewer women died in the letrozole group (194, 7·9%) than in the tamoxifen group (211, 8·6%), but this diﬀerence was not statistically signiﬁcant (HR=0·91, 95% CI 0·75–1·11); p=0·35).

resulted in unblinding of the trial while most patients were still on treatment or receiving placebo.11 Results of updated ITT analyses suggested persistence of a disease-free survival beneﬁt associated with letrozole, despite 73% of patients on placebo crossing over to letrozole, and no eﬀect on overall survival.17 No results are available yet from trials that directly compare use of aromatase inhibitor monotherapy with a sequential or switch strategy. Direct evidence from the sequential therapy arms of BIG 1-98 and from the TEAM trial18 is awaited with keen interest. Caution should be used in the indirect comparison of the monotherapy and switch trials due to confounding associated with the diﬀerent patient populations and pre-treatment with tamoxifen. Review of major eﬃcacy and safety ﬁndings, however, allows an assessment of overall consistency and putative identiﬁcation of any serious adverse risks. Some authors have attempted to extrapolate from the available trials,19,20 but their conclusions are in conﬂict as to which strategy will give the best 10-year outcome, and show the need for direct randomised evidence. Similarly, although MA17 investigated the use of an aromatase inhibitor in the extended adjuvant setting, no direct evidence is available about the potential beneﬁts for continuing treatment with either upfront monotherapy with an aromatase inhibitor or the switch strategy beyond the ﬁrst 5 years after diagnosis. With the most mature post-treatment data on treatment with an aromatase inhibitor yet to be published, switching to exemestane seems to have been safe and well tolerated; serious side-eﬀects were rare, and some might be attributable to withdrawal from tamoxifen. A 27% (95% CI 3–58) increase in risk of fracture was noted after the switch to exemestane, attributable to an increase in bone turnover. In the IES bone sub-study,21 in which changes in bone mineral density were assessed, the median loss of lumbar spine bone mineral density in the exemestane group was 2·9% at 6 months, 3·6% at 12 months, and 4·0% at 24 months. The rate of bone loss associated with exemestane in this study seemed to be partly attenuated by previous treatment with tamoxifen; after the initial rapid rate of bone loss due to the cessation of bone-turnover suppression induced by tamoxifen, the subsequent rate of on-treatment bone loss was thereafter less than 1% per year. Importantly, no patient with a normal bone mineral density at entry to the study became osteoporotic during treatment with exemestane, an observation that has important implications for the follow-up of patients. The number of patients with myocardial infarction was very low in both treatment groups even tough patients were drawn from a population at risk of adverse cardiac events because of their age. Most patients who developed myocardial infarction after treatment with exemestane had a history of hypertension; emphasising the importance of checking blood pressure. Notably, except for a modest (6–9%) drop in HDL cholesterol, treatment with exemestane has no eﬀect on concentrations of lipids and www.thelancet.com Vol 369 February 17, 2007 

coagulation factors in plasma in patients with early breast cancer.22 The results of IES, in common with other studies, show that patients receiving an aromatase inhibitor have a greater incidence of musculoskeletal complications than do tamoxifen-treated patients. This problem most often occurs in the form of arthralgia or, less commonly, carpal tunnel syndrome. Conversely—and consistent with results of other trials with aromatase inhibitors—a lower incidence of gynaecological complications occurred with exemestane than with tamoxifen, including vaginal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, polyps or ﬁbroids, and endometrial cancers. Furthermore, switching to exemestane had no adverse eﬀect on quality of life.23 Fewer deaths due to second primary cancers were noted in patients who switched to exemestane compared with those who continued taking tamoxifen, but the reason for this ﬁnding is unclear. A chance imbalance is possible, since diﬀerentiation of metastatic disease from new primary cancer can be diﬃcult, but independent review of such cases did not result in material changes to the ﬁndings. At most, these results are hypothesisgenerating. In summary, switching treatment to exemestane after 2–3 years of tamoxifen improves disease-free survival and translates into a modest reduction in risk of death. This treatment seems to be safe and well tolerated. The ﬁndings of IES also show that the beneﬁt of sequential administration of tamoxifen and an aromatase inhibitor in patients with endocrine-responsive breast cancer persists for some years after discontinuation of the aromatase inhibitor. These results seem to be independent of any tumour characteristics that we have measured; however future research should investigate whether molecular markers exist that predict which patients beneﬁt from which endocrine treatment strategy.
