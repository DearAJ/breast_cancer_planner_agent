Purpose The Intergroup Exemestane Study, an investigator-led study of 4,724 postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer (clinical trial information: ISRCTN11883920), has previously demonstrated that a switch from adjuvant endocrine therapy after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen to exemestane was associated with clinically relevant improvements in efﬁcacy. Here, we report the ﬁnal efﬁcacy analyses of this cohort. Patients and Methods Patients who remained disease free after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen were randomly assigned to continue tamoxifen or switch to exemestane to complete a total of 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Given the large number of non–breast cancer–related deaths now reported, breast cancer–free survival (BCFS), with censorship of intercurrent deaths, was the primary survival end point of interest. Analyses focus on patients with estrogen receptor-positive or unknown tumors (n = 4,599). Results At the time of the data snapshot, median follow-up was 120 months. In the population that was estrogen receptor positive or had unknown estrogen receptor status, 1,111 BCFS events were observed with 508 (22.1%) of 2,294 patients in the exemestane group and 603 (26.2%) of 2,305 patients in the tamoxifen group. The data corresponded to an absolute difference (between exemestane and tamoxifen) at 10 years of 4.0% (95% CI, 1.2% to 6.7%), and the hazard ratio (HR) of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.92) favored exemestane. This difference remained in multivariable analysis that was adjusted for nodal status, prior use of hormone replacement therapy, and prior chemotherapy (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.90; P , .001). A modest improvement in overall survival was seen with exemestane; the absolute difference (between exemestane and tamoxifen) at 10 years in the population that was estrogen receptor positive or had unknown estrogen receptor status was 2.1% (95% CI, 20.5% to 4.6%), and the HR was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.01; P = .08). For the intention-to-treat population, the absolute difference was 1.6% (95% CI, 20.9% to 4.1%); the HR was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.03, P = .15). No statistically signiﬁcant difference was observed in the proportion of patients who reported a fracture event in the post-treatment period. Conclusion The Intergroup Exemestane Study and contemporaneous studies have established that a strategy of switching to an aromatase inhibitor after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen can lead to sustained beneﬁts in terms of reduction of disease recurrence and breast cancer mortality.

INTRODUCTION 

Despite improvements in adjuvant treatment, breast cancer remains the most frequent cause of cancer-related death in women; approximately 508,000 deaths were reported worldwide in 2011.1 For patients diagnosed with estrogen receptor 

(ER)–positive disease, risk of disease relapse remains for more than 15 years after initial diagnosis; and recent research has demonstrated that patients who received chemotherapy had a cumulative risk of relapse at 15 years comparable to that of patients with ER-negative disease.2 Aromatase inhibitors reduce recurrence rates and 10-year breast cancer mortality rates compared © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

with tamoxifen. However, the optimal way to schedule aromatase inhibitors is still debated.3 The Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) was an investigatorled, Pﬁzer-sponsored trial to assess the affect on disease-related outcome, adverse events, and quality of life of a switch to exemestane after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen compared with continuation up to 5 years of tamoxifen.4-11 The most recent update of efﬁcacy analyses published in 2012 (data snapshot on December 7, 2009) after a median follow-up of 91 months demonstrated that the highly statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁt of a switch to exemestane on disease-free survival (DFS) observed at initial publication was maintained, and this translated to a modest improvement in overall survival (OS).6 IES was the ﬁrst trial published to describe the beneﬁts of a switch from tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane) at 2 to 3 years, and it was one of the pivotal trials to assess the role of aromatase inhibitors in combination with or as a replacement for standard tamoxifen treatment.3 Whether the strategy results in long-term sustained improvement in DFS or OS remains controversial, although our previous report suggested that this was the case.6 Recent analyses of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial have sought to identify clinical and biologic factors associated with disease relapse after completion of endocrine therapy.12,13 Nodal involvement and tumor size are the most important clinical factors for prediction of relapse both during and after treatment completion in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.14,15 The other aim of this study, therefore, was to establish which prognostic features were important in the IES trial, which used a switching strategy, especially after the end of endocrine therapy. Here, we present the ﬁnal efﬁcacy analysis of the IES, along with exploratory analyses to investigate clinical factors that affect the risk of distant relapse after completion of endocrine therapy. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients Details of trial design, eligibility criteria, and study procedures have been presented previously.4-6 Brieﬂy, eligible patients were postmenopausal women with ER-positive/unknown primary invasive breast cancer who remained disease free and on treatment after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen. At random assignment, women were allocated to continue tamoxifen (20 mg [or 30 mg in Denmark] daily) or to switch to exemestane (25 mg daily) for the remainder of the 5-year endocrine therapy period. Timing of analyses was preplanned and triggered according to the last patient randomly assigned to reach her 10-year follow up. This analysis includes all data received as of September 4, 2013. Efﬁcacy analyses presented here were performed on the main IES analysis population, which included patients whose tumors were ER positive (n = 4,052; 85.8%) plus those whose ER status was unknown (n = 547; 11.6%). Analyses excluded patients who had ER-negative disease (n = 125; 2.6%) who would not have been eligible for the trial had their receptor statuses been known at trial entry. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of overall survival is included for completeness. 

death). As reported previously,6 the proportion of patients who experienced intercurrent death increased as the IES population aged, which decreased the sensitivity of DFS to detect differences between treatments in breast cancer outcome. Therefore, breast cancer–free survival (BCFS), in which intercurrent deaths are censored, is now regarded as a more direct estimate of the treatment effect on breast cancer outcome in the long term. Other secondary end points presented include OS (deﬁned as time from random assignment to death as a result of any cause), breast cancer– speciﬁc survival (BCSS; deﬁned as time from random assignment to breast cancer death, including death as a result of unknown cause and other cause after recurrence), time to contralateral breast cancer (CLB; deﬁned as time to contralateral breast cancer with patients censored at time of nonbreast second primary cancer), and time to distant recurrence (TTDR; deﬁned as time to distant recurrence or death as a result of breast cancer or unknown cause without prior recurrence). Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to compare survival end points between randomly assigned treatment groups. Multivariable analysis that was adjusted for known prognostic factors of nodal status, chemotherapy use, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use also was conducted. Sites of ﬁrst distant recurrence were grouped as either visceral, bone, or soft tissue/nodal. Patients were assigned to multiple groups, when relevant. Progression of metastatic disease subsequent to the initial distant recurrence was ignored. Events in which the site of recurrence was unknown were excluded from this part of the analysis. The overall and age-related incidences of non–breast cancer second primary cancers were investigated to conﬁrm the observation in previous reports of a differential pattern according to randomly assigned treatment.5,6 When patients reported more than one nonbreast second primary cancer (n = 6), the ﬁrst reported event was included. Second primaries reported with no conﬁrmed date of diagnosis were excluded (n = 8). Competing-risks analyses were undertaken to assess the impact of the randomly assigned treatment on breast cancer events (local recurrence, distant recurrence, CLB, ipsilateral breast cancer, and death as a result of breast cancer or an unknown cause) allowing for competing risks of intercurrent death and nonbreast second primary cancer. Patients were included on the basis of which event occurred ﬁrst: breast cancer event or competing risk event. Gray’s test was used to compare the two treatment groups with respect to breast cancer event in the presence of competing risks.16 Landmark analyses were performed to investigate the factors related to distant recurrence after the end of endocrine therapy. TTDR was the end point of interest, and survival time was partitioned at 2.5 years, which represented the approximate end of endocrine therapy in IES. The effect of randomly assigned treatment and of a number of patient and tumor characteristics on TTDR after 2.5 years were assessed, both as single variables and together in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Full adverse event4-7,11 and quality of life9,10 data have been reported previously and, therefore, are not included in this article, but an updated estimate of post-treatment fracture incidence by treatment received is presented. This estimate includes all fractures that occurred . 6 months after treatment completion in patients who received at least 1 day of treatment, and events were censored after recurrence or new second primary cancer. Analyses were performed with STATA, version 13.2 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX). All statistical tests were two sided, and P , .05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. 

RESULTS Statistical Analysis The primary end point of the IES was DFS, deﬁned as time from random assignment to local or distant breast cancer recurrence, new primary breast cancer, or death without disease relapse (intercurrent 2508

Patient characteristics have been reported previously; patients were well balanced between treatment groups.5,6 In summary, 2,089 (44.2%) of 4,724 patients had node-positive disease, and 1,542 (32.6%) of 4,724 patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy. The mean age at random assignment was 64.2 years (standard deviation, 8.2 years). At the time of the data snapshot (September 4, 2013), the median follow-up in patients still known to be alive was 120.0 months (interquartile range, 114.8 to 122.0 months; range, 2.9 to 164.1 months); the analysis was based on more than 39,000 woman-years of follow-up. A total of 74.7% of patients had at least 10 years of follow-up or had previously died. 

Efficacy In the ER-positive/unknown population, 1,111 of 4,599 patients experienced a BCFS event (508 [22.1%] of 2,294 in the exemestane group and 603 [26.2%] of 2,305 in the tamoxifen group). A reduction in the risk of breast cancer–related events was observed; the absolute difference at 10 years was 4.0% (95% CI, 1.2% to 6.7%), and the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.92) in favor of a switch to exemestane (Fig 2A). In the ER-positive/unknown population, 940 of 4,599 patients died (445 [19.4%] of 2,294 in the exemestane group and 495 [21.5%] of 2,305 in the tamoxifen group). A modest improvement in OS was seen with exemestane; the absolute survival difference at 10 years was 2.1% (95% CI, 20.5% to 4.6%), and the HR was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.01), in favor of a switch to exemestane (Fig 2B). The numerical difference in deaths was observed mainly in deaths as a result of breast cancer, and rates of intercurrent deaths were similar between randomly assigned treatment groups (Table 1). Results were similar when the ITT population was considered, with 467 (19.9%) of 2,352 patients in the exemestane group dying, and 510 (21.5%) of 2,372 patients in the tamoxifen group dying (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.03; Fig 2C). In the ER-positive/unknown population, 659 of 4,599 patients reported a BCSS event (303 [13.2%] of 2,294 patients jco.org

in the exemestane group, and 356 [15.4%] of 2,305 patients in the tamoxifen group). The absolute BCSS difference at 10 years was 2.3% (95% CI, 20.0% to 4.6%), and the HR was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.98) in favor of a switch to exemestane (Fig 2D). A total of 1,392 DFS events have been reported in only the patients with ER-positive/unknown disease (650 [28.3%] of 2,294 in the exemestane group, and 742 [32.2%] of 2,305 in the tamoxifen group). The highly signiﬁcant improvement in DFS associated with a switch to exemestane that was noted previously remained, and no convergence of survival curves was seen (Fig 2E). This sustained beneﬁt translated to an absolute difference in the proportion who remained alive and disease free at 10 years of 3.8% (95% CI, 0.9% to 6.6%). This difference remained in multivariable analyses that adjusted for nodal status, prior HRT use, and prior chemotherapy; the HR of 0.83 favored a switch to exemestane (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.93; P = .001). With competing risks methodology, in which all outcomes were investigated in a single analysis, the cumulative incidence of intercurrent deaths increased steadily throughout the follow-up period and was comparable between randomly assigned treatment groups (Fig 3). In consideration of breast cancer events (after adjustment for competing risks), the early beneﬁt from a switch to exemestane was maintained throughout follow-up (Gray’s test P = .002). No statistically signiﬁcant difference was seen between the randomly assigned groups in the number of patients who reported a new primary CLB (exemestane [n = 56] and tamoxifen [n = 75]; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03; Table 1), although the observed HR was consistent with that of other trials that have explored the additional preventive beneﬁts of aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen.17 Numerically, fewer nonbreast second primary cancers were reported with exemestane (n = 143) than with tamoxifen (n = 191; Table 1). Analyses of incidence of distant recurrence and nonbreast second primary cancer by age at random assignment reﬂect data presented previously; there was a suggestion that second primary cancer incidence increases with age, but © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

no association was observed between age and distant recurrence incidence (trend test P = .08 and .22, respectively; Appendix Table A1 and Fig A1, online only). Results of TTDR analyses across the entire follow-up period reﬂected other efﬁcacy end points. The absolute difference in the rate of distant recurrence or breast cancer death at 10 years was 2.6% (95% CI, 0.2% to 5.1%), and the HR was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.96) in favor of a switch to exemestane. Analyses of TTDR after completion of endocrine therapy—equivalent to approximately 5 years after diagnosis—included 4,147 patients known to be event free at 2.5 years after random assignment (exemestane [n = 2,091] and tamoxifen [n = 2,056]; Table 2). No statistically signiﬁcant difference in TTDR during this period was observed between randomly assigned treatment groups (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.10; P = .41), which reﬂects the observation that the initial difference in disease outcome observed during the treatment period was maintained throughout the follow-up period. After inclusion jco.org 

in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, age at random assignment, nodal status, hormone receptor status, previous HRT use, and tumor size but not grade, had a signiﬁcant effect on the risk of TTDR event after completion of endocrine therapy (ie, of late relapse). Of note, risk of late distant recurrence in patients with tumor sizes . 5 cm at diagnosis was almost double that of patients with tumors , 2 cm (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.90), and the risk was more than six times greater in patients who had $10 nodes involved than in patients who were node-negative at random assignment (HR, 6.10; 95% CI, 4.41 to 8.44) after adjustment for other factors.

DISCUSSION 

This updated and ﬁnal analysis of IES demonstrates that the beneﬁt associated with a switch to exemestane observed early in the follow-up period remained undiminished by additional follow-up. As the IES population aged, incidences of non–breast cancer deaths and nonbreast second primary cancers have increased, which has led to a dilution of OS results. However, a modest beneﬁt from the switch to exemestane can still be seen, with an absolute difference in OS at 10 years after random assignment of 1.6%. As suggested previously, BCFS (which does not include non–breast cancer deaths) remains the most appropriate measure of treatment efﬁcacy in this setting; an absolute beneﬁt of 4.0% from the switch to exemestane was observed at 10 years. Analyses that account for competing events of intercurrent death and nonbreast second primary cancer showed an absolute difference in breast cancer event at 10 years of 3%. The IES trial compared treatments for a duration of up to 5 years. Recent large, randomized controlled trials18-20 have demonstrated an improvement in disease-related outcomes associated with continuation of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor treatment past the standard 5 years of treatment. However, long-term use of endocrine therapy is associated with many adverse effects, some of which substantially affect patient well-being, such as osteoporosis, vasomotor problems, and musculoskeletal conditions.21 There remains great clinical need to identify patients who remain at high risk of disease relapse after completion of 5 years of endocrine therapy who may beneﬁt from additional treatment 2512

and, conversely, patients who may be spared this treatment because of low residual risk. Results of analyses partitioned at 2.5 years after random assignment support conclusions made previously that the difference in disease-related outcome observed at 10 years between treatment groups is due to maintenance of the initial on-treatment divergence between groups rather than any emerging post-treatment effect. Multivariable analyses of clinical factors that affect the time to late distant recurrence identiﬁed age at random assignment, nodal involvement, hormone receptor status, previous HRT use, and tumor size, although the relationship between HRT use and late distant recurrence is confounded by geographic region. The observation that tumor grade no longer retains prognostic signiﬁcance in this setting after adjustment for other factors reﬂects previous analyses of retrospective case series22 and comparable analyses of the ATAC trial.12 The authors of this analysis also demonstrated the value of the PAM50-based risk of recurrence score as an independent predictor of late distant recurrence; other molecular scores studied (eg, IHC4, Oncotype DX) did not add prognostic information when added to clinical data.13 In summary, the IES and other contemporaneous studies have established that a strategy of a switch to an aromatase inhibitor after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen can lead to sustained beneﬁts in terms of reduction of disease recurrence and breast cancer mortality. The identiﬁcation of patients who remain at higher risk of disease recurrence after the completion of 5 years of endocrine therapy (whether tamoxifen, an aromatase inhibitor, or a combination of the two) according to clinical factors, such as nodal involvement and tumor size, will aid decision making about the administration of additional endocrine therapy or additional therapeutic agents.
