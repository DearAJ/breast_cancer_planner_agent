Purpose The effects of ovarian function suppression (OFS) on survival and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated in a phase III trial in which premenopausal women were randomly assigned to tamoxifen with or without OFS. Patients and Methods Premenopausal women with axillary node-negative, hormone receptor–positive breast cancer tumors measuring ⱕ 3 cm were randomly assigned to tamoxifen alone versus tamoxifen plus OFS; adjuvant chemotherapy was not permitted. Primary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included toxicity and patient-reported outcomes. Patient-reported outcome data included health-related quality of life, menopausal symptoms, and sexual function. These were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually for up to 5 years after registration. Results In all, 345 premenopausal women were enrolled: 171 on tamoxifen alone and 174 on tamoxifen plus OFS. With a median follow-up of 9.9 years, there was no significant difference between arms for DFS (5-year rate: 87.9% v 89.7%; log-rank P ⫽ .62) or OS (5-year rate: 95.2% v 97.6%; log-rank P ⫽ .67). Grade 3 or higher toxicity was more common in the tamoxifen plus OFS arm (22.4% v 12.3%; P ⫽ .004). Patients treated with tamoxifen plus OFS had more menopausal symptoms, lower sexual activity, and inferior health-related quality of life at 3-year follow-up (P ⬍ .01 for all). Differences diminished with further follow-up. Conclusion When added to tamoxifen, OFS results in more menopausal symptoms and sexual dysfunction, which contributes to inferior self-reported health-related quality of life. Because of early closure, this study is underpowered for drawing conclusions about the impact on survival when adding OFS to tamoxifen.

INTRODUCTION 

Ovarian function was related to breast cancer in 1882, when Nunn1 reported cancer regression 6 months after menopause. The first known therapeutic oophorectomy occurred in 1895 on a woman with recurrent breast cancer.2,3 Pharmacologic advances involving luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and improved surgical technique permitted the study of ovarian function 

suppression (OFS) in the adjuvant setting. Several trials demonstrate benefits from ovarian suppression or surgical oophorectomy equaling or exceeding benefits from cytotoxic chemotherapies in patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer.4-9 A meta-analysis10 by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Group suggests that OFS reduces breast cancer recurrence and mortality in the absence of other therapies. However, a second metaanalysis8 suggests that LHRH agonists alone do © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

not improve recurrence or mortality, although adding them to other therapies reduces both recurrence and death following recurrence. Some consider OFS to be standard of care.11 Questions about OFS persist, and its role remains uncertain. It is not the recommended standard of care in North America, where tamoxifen alone is considered standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women.12 In the absence of definitive survival benefits, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) should be considered when use of OFS is considered. Understanding the additional toxicity from OFS beyond that of tamoxifen is complicated. Some published studies assess OFS versus cytotoxic chemotherapy.5,6,13-15 Other studies assess the impact of OFS in settings in which women are essentially past cytotoxic chemotherapy (which induces ovarian failure in premenopausal women).7,16-18 Only a few studies contain a tamoxifen alone arm.19,20 Furthermore, most published trialsofOFShavenotreportedPROssuch as HRQoL, hot flashes, and sexual dysfunction. The SOFT (Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial) study will address the value that OFS adds to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal women. SOFT randomlyassignedwomentotamoxifenaloneversustamoxifenplusOFS or aromatase inhibitor plus OFS. That phase III trial has completed accrual, but definitive results have not been reported for the tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus OFS arms.21 SOFT included a significant proportion of women (54%) receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.21 The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) undertook a phase III trial comparing tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus OFS in premenopausal women with node-negative, hormone receptor–positive primary invasive breast cancers who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (Phase III Comparison of Tamoxifen v Tamoxifen With Ovarian Ablation in Premenopausal Women With Axillary Node–Negative Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer ⱕ 3 cm; E-3193, INT-0142). Primary objectives included comparing the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between the two arms. Secondary objectives included toxicity and PROs such as comparison of menopausal symptoms, sexual function, and HRQoL between treatment arms. The trial was terminated before reaching the enrollment goal because of slow accrual; however, it completed the necessary accrual to meet the PRO objectives. We report the study results here. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient Population Eligible patients were premenopausal women with node-negative, estrogen receptor (ER) –positive and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) –positive primary invasive breast cancers. Primary tumors had to be ⱕ 3 cm in greatest diameter. Randomization was required within 84 days of definitive breast surgery (mastectomy or breast conservation). Premenopausal status was defined as a menstrual period within the past 6 months without prior oophorectomy, or in the case of prior hysterectomy, as age 55 years or younger with one or both ovaries remaining and an estradiol level in the normal premenopausal range. Patients could not have received prior systemic therapy for breast cancer, aside from ⱕ 12 weeks of tamoxifen. Patients were ineligible if they had any evidence of locally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis. The institutional review boards at each registering institution approved the protocol. All patients provided written informed consent. 2

Treatment In this open-label, randomized phase III trial, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to tamoxifen alone or tamoxifen plus OFS by using permuted blocks within strata with dynamic balancing across main institutions and their affiliated networks. Stratification factors included hormone receptor status, tumor size, and type of OFS. The treatment schedule for the tamoxifen alone arm was tamoxifen 20 mg orally per day for 5 years; the schedule for the tamoxifen plus OFS arm was tamoxifen 20 mg orally per day for 5 years combined with OFS. OFS was per patient or physician choice and could consist of LHRH analog (goserelin 3.6 mg depot every 4 weeks for 5 years beginning within 4 weeks of random assignment; leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg every 4 weeks for 5 years beginning within 4 weeks of random assignment), surgical ablation (done within 12 weeks of random assignment), or radiation ovarian ablation (20 Gy in 10 fractions within 12 weeks of random assignment22). No dose reductions were permitted. Other adjuvant systemic therapies including chemotherapy were not permitted. End Points and Assessments The primary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included toxicity and difference in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) scores at 6 and 12 months. Additional PROs were prespecified as exploratory end points. DFS was defined as time from random assignment to the earliest of disease recurrence, new primary breast cancer, or death as a result of any cause, censoring patients without recurrence or death at the date of last disease assessment known to be disease free. OS was defined as time from random assignment to death as a result of any cause, with living patients censored at last evaluation date. Disease recurrence and survival were assessed every 6 months for the first 5 years and yearly thereafter. Adverse events were assessed on the same schedule by using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 1.23 Participants were surveyed to evaluate menopausal symptoms, sexual function, and HRQoL. Assessment of menopausal symptoms was conducted with questions from the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Intervention checklist,24 which consisted of 15 questions devoted to various symptoms. Assessment of sexual function was conducted by using the Sexual Activity Questionnaire,25 which consisted of five questions about sexual activity. Assessment of HRQoL was measured by using FACT-B (Version 3), which consisted of 27 general questions pertaining to patients with all cancers plus nine additional questions specific to patients with breast cancer.26 Assessments of PROs were performed at baseline, at 6 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter for up to 5 years following registration. Statistical Analysis The target enrollment was 1,600 eligible patients, with 90% power to detect 33% reduction in the hazard of recurrence from adding OFS to tamoxifen (5-year DFS rate of 83.0% v 88.3%) by using a log-rank test with a one-sided type I error rate of 0.025. This design also gives 81% power to detect a 33% reduction in the hazard of death (5-year OS of 90.0% for tamoxifen alone v 93.2% for tamoxifen plus OFS) by using a log-rank test with a one-sided type I error rate of 0.025. For PROs, 110 patients per arm give 90% power to detect a difference of five points in the FACT-B total score at 6 and 12 months by using a two-sample t test with an overall type I error rate of 0.05 (Bonferroni adjustment was made for these comparisons), assuming the common standard deviation of 10.5. The target sample size for PRO end points was 367 patients, assuming a 40% loss in PROs by 12 months, for an effective sample size of 220. All analyses were conducted in all eligible patients following the intentto-treat principle. Associations between categorical or binary variables were examined by using the ␹2 and Fisher’s exact tests.27 The distribution of OS and DFS was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method28 and compared between treatment arms by the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards model29 was used to estimate the treatment effect after adjusting for baseline covariates. A two-sample t test was used to compare PRO scores or score changes between treatmentarms.AnalysisofvariancetestwasusedtocomparePROscoresbasedon type of OFS.

to assess the treatment difference over time, assuming that any missing data were missing at random. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by using the lognormal survival model for analyzing longitudinal data that incorporates the nonignorable censoring mechanism.30 A bootstrap method31 was applied to estimate the SEs of the regression coefficients in the lognormal survival models. All P values were for two-sided tests; P ⬍ .05 was considered statistically significant except for FACT-B comparisons at 6 and 12 months (P ⬍ .025 was used based on Bonferroni adjustment). No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons for other end points. SAS 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and STATA 11.2 (STATA, College Station, TX) were used for analyses. 

RESULTS 

Patient Demographics and Disease Characteristics A total of 345 participants were enrolled between September 1994 and November 1997, 171 on tamoxifen alone and 174 on 

tamoxifen plus OFS. The final analysis, including all clinical outcomes and PRO end points, was conducted in March 2003 with median follow-up time of 5.86 years. However, participants were observed for recurrence and survival until June 2007 (median follow-up, 9.9 years; range, 0.2 to 12.3 years). DFS and OS analyses were updated in July 2011 and are presented here. The CONSORT diagram is provided in Figure 1. Of 345 registered participants, eight (four receiving tamoxifen and four receiving tamoxifen plus OFS) were ineligible; one patient (tamoxifen plus OFS) withdrew after random assignment and thus never started the assigned treatments. By the intent-to-treat principle, the total number of analyzable participants is the 337 eligible patients. The two arms were well balanced with respect to known patient characteristics (Table 1). At study entry, the median age was 45 years (range, 26 to 55 years). Most participants were white (91%) with tumors ⱕ 2 cm

(83%), which were both estrogen receptor–positive and progesterone receptor–positive (88%). Participants randomly assigned to tamoxifen plus OFS generally chose to undergo surgical ablation of ovarian function via oophorectomy (42%), followed by medical suppression with an LHRH agonist (36%). Treatment As of March 2003, 116 participants (69%) receiving tamoxifen and 123 (72%) receiving tamoxifen plus OFS reported discontinuing treatment; the reasons cited for treatment discontinuation were similar between the arms. The most common reason cited was treatment completion (68 [41%] receiving tamoxifen and 77 [45%] receiving tamoxifen plus OFS; P ⫽ .441). Twenty-nine patients (8.6%; 12 receiving tamoxifen, 17 receiving tamoxifen plus OFS) discontinued treatment because of adverse events and 30 patients (8.9%; 16 receiving tamoxifen, 14 receiving tamoxifen plus OFS) discontinued as a result of recurrence or death. In addition to patients who discontinued treatment, 15 patients (9.0%) receiving tamoxifen plus OFS refused OFS and four (2.4%) receiving tamoxifen also received OFS. DFS and OS As of June 2007 (when follow-up for survival and recurrence stopped), 45 DFS events (tamoxifen, 24; tamoxifen plus OFS, 21) and 4

24 deaths had been observed among 337 eligible participants (Fig 2). The 5-year OS rate for tamoxifen was 95.2% (95% CI, 90.5% to 97.6%) compared with a rate of 97.6% (95% CI, 93.6% to 99.1%) for tamoxifen plus OFS (log-rank P ⫽ .67; Fig 2A). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.19 (95% CI, 0.52 to 2.70) for tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus OFS. The 5-year DFS rate for tamoxifen was 87.9% (95% CI, 81.9% to 92.0%) compared with the rate of 89.7% (95% CI, 83.9% to 93.5%) for tamoxifen plus OFS (log-rank P ⫽ .62; Fig 2B). The adjusted HR was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.64 to 2.12) for tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus OFS. Appendix Tables A1 and A2 (online only) display the results for the prespecified subgroup analysis based on OFS type and race. The estimated HRs for DFS and OS were not statistically significant, based on OFS type (Appendix Table A1). Among white women, the HR was 1.18 (95% CI, 0.63 to 2.21; P ⫽ .60) for DFS for tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus OFS, and among nonwhite women, the HR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.13 to 7.96; P ⫽ .98; Appendix Table A2). Toxicity The most common grade 3 or higher toxicities were hot flashes, weight gain, neuropsychiatric adverse effects, such as anxiety or depression, and neurologic adverse effects, such as somnolence and confusion (Table 2). The proportion of grade 3 or greater toxicity was higher for tamoxifen plus OFS compared with tamoxifen (22.4% v 12.3%; P ⫽ .004). No lethal adverse events were reported in the study. PROs Overall, compliance with PRO assessments was high and was similar between the two arms in all follow-up visits in the study (Fig 1). More than 93% of the patients submitted the PRO forms at baseline in both arms. At months 6 and 12, the retention rate was 83% and 79%, respectively, in the overall sample; thus, the prespecified effective sample size of 220 patients at 12 months was achieved. Combining all time points, a total of 1,889 surveys (68.2%) were completed. Among missing surveys, 433 (15.6%) were missing because of institutional error, 153 (5.5%) because of patient refusal, and 46 (1.7%) because of patient expiration. Table 3 and Figure 3 display the mean scores for PRO end points by treatment arm at each visit time in analyzable patients per protocol. Patients receiving tamoxifen plus OFS reported worse HRQoL as measured by the mean scores on both the FACTGeneral (FACT-G) and FACT-B cancer subscales compared with those receiving tamoxifen alone at all time points (Figs 3A and 3B). These differences became more pronounced over time and reached statistical and clinical significance for FACT-G at year 3 (difference, 6.39). This difference decreased over time. Women receiving tamoxifen plus OFS had more menopausal symptoms at all time points compared with women receiving tamoxifen alone, with statistically significant differences at 1, 2, and 3 years of follow-up (Fig 3C, Table 3). Sexual activity was lower among women receiving tamoxifen plus OFS compared with women receiving tamoxifen alone at all follow-up time points after month 6 (Fig 3D, Table 3), and differences were statistically significant. Appendix Table A3 (online only) displays PRO score changes between follow-up and baseline visits by arm. The tamoxifen plus OFS arm persistently had more differences from baseline starting at 6 months in menopausal and sexual activity compared with the tamoxifen alone arm. JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY

showed no significant changes compared with the previous results after considering the possible informative censoring as a result of death (data not shown). PROs were examined by OFS type among patients on the tamoxifen plus OFS arm in the report. Patients with surgically induced menopause had slightly lower scores over all PRO end points at year 3, although this was statistically significant only for the FACT-B subscale and Sexual Activity Questionnaire (Appendix Table A5, online only). Given the small numbers as well as small overall differences in scores, results should be interpreted with caution. DISCUSSION 

E-3193 is a randomized phase III trial comparing tamoxifen alone with tamoxifen plus OFS for premenopausal women with earlystage breast cancer. The trial closed to accrual before meeting the enrollment goal for survival end points. DFS and OS were excellent overall; because of this and the early termination of accrual, the DFS and OS comparisons are underpowered. However, valuable data about toxicity, menopausal symptom burden, sexual function, and HRQoL were obtained. Accrual met the protocol’s prespecified target goal for the PRO end points. PRO results suggest that adding ovarian suppression to tamoxifen leads to increased toxicity, more menopausal symptom burden, and lowered sexual function, all ultimately translating into lower HRQoL. The difference in HRQoL scores between the two arms is statistically significant and clinical meaningful by year 3.32 However, the negative impact of OFS diminished over time, likely because increasing numbers of women receiving tamoxifen alone reached menopause (median age at study entry was 45 years). Outcomes for the tamoxifen alone arm in particular trended upward and were significantly better at year 3 than at baseline, consistent with other studies of HRQoL in women receiving endocrine therapy.33 Limited data are available comparing OFS in addition to or in place of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal breast cancer © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

(ie, tamoxifen). PRO data are similarly lacking. As shown in Table 4,34-40 studies have mainly examined OFS compared with or combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Trials examining tamoxifen alone versus tamoxifen plus OFS have used short durations of OFS (2 years). Our results suggest that durations of less than 3 years fail to capture the adverse effect peak and the HRQoL nadir from OFS.34,35 Because inclusion criteria varied widely from trial to trial, it is difficult to quantify the impact of chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure in women randomly as6

SOFT will provide valuable insights into the survival benefit from OFS as well as its impact on PROs such as hot flashes and loss of sexual interest. Particular strengths of E-3193 (when viewed in light of SOFT) include the maturity of our data.

a result of OFS. This is a unique feature of our data that will not be recapitulated by SOFT (although SOFT eligibility requirements carefully define the required residual menstrual function.) One limitation of our study was the early termination of the trial because of poor accrual (although this applies only to the efficacy end points because the sample size needed for the PRO end points was achieved). In addition, participants were not blinded to assigned treatment arm, which could have influenced their perception of adverse effects. However, practical considerations make it unlikely that patients and treatingphysicianscouldhavebeenblindedtocontinuedmenstrualfunction. Another limitation is the absence of data on other outcomes potentially impacted by OFS such as bone health, vaginal atrophy, or cognitive function. Finally, as is typical for PRO end points, multiple comparison adjustment was made only for the primary PRO end points, although multiple measures were administered at multiple time points in the study. In conclusion, this study provides unique insight into the detrimental impact of OFS beyond that seen with tamoxifen alone. The impact of OFS on PROs is not complicated by the prior use of chemotherapy and its effects on ovarian function, unlike in many other studies. Questions generated by this research include exploring shorter durations of OFS, which might result in less symptom burden for patients. Given these data and in the absence of definitive data for improvement in DFS or OS with OFS, the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines are appropriately cautious about adding OFS www.jco.org 

to tamoxifen.12 These data provide valuable information for oncologists and patients who are debating whether to add OFS to tamoxifen.

Tamoxifen With or Without Ovarian Suppression 

GLOSSARY TERMS 

estrogen receptor (ER): ligand-activated nuclear proteins, belonging to the class of nuclear receptors, present in many breast cancer cells that are important in the progression of hormone-dependent cancers. After binding, the receptor-ligand complex activates gene transcription. There are two types of estrogen receptors (ER␣ and ER␤). ER␣ is one of the most important proteins controlling breast cancer function. ER␤ is present in much lower levels in breast cancer, and its function is uncertain. Estrogen receptor status guides therapeutic decisions in breast cancer.
