Background: Adjuvant abemaciclib combined with endocrine therapy (ET) previously demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) in hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, node-positive, high-risk early breast cancer at the second interim analysis, however follow-up was limited. Here, we present results of the prespeciﬁed primary outcome analysis and an additional follow-up analysis. Patients and methods: This global, phase III, open-label trial randomized (1 : 1) 5637 patients to adjuvant ET for 5 years  abemaciclib for 2 years. Cohort 1 enrolled patients with 4 positive axillary lymph nodes (ALNs), or 1-3 positive ALNs and either grade 3 disease or tumor 5 cm. Cohort 2 enrolled patients with 1-3 positive ALNs and centrally determined high Ki-67 index (20%). The primary endpoint was IDFS in the intent-to-treat population (cohorts 1 and 2). Secondary endpoints were IDFS in patients with high Ki-67, DRFS, overall survival, and safety. Results: At the primary outcome analysis, with 19 months median follow-up time, abemaciclib þ ET resulted in a 29% reduction in the risk of developing an IDFS event [hazard ratio (HR) ¼ 0.71, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.58-0.87; nominal P ¼ 0.0009]. At the additional follow-up analysis, with 27 months median follow-up and 90% of patients off treatment, IDFS (HR ¼ 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.82; nominal P < 0.0001) and DRFS (HR ¼ 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.83; nominal P < 0.0001) beneﬁt was maintained. The absolute improvements in 3-year IDFS and DRFS rates were 5.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Whereas Ki-67 index was prognostic, abemaciclib beneﬁt was consistent regardless of Ki-67 index. Safety data were consistent with the known abemaciclib risk proﬁle. Conclusion: Abemaciclib þ ET signiﬁcantly improved IDFS in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, node-positive, high-risk early breast cancer, with an acceptable safety proﬁle. Ki-67 index was prognostic, but abemaciclib beneﬁt was observed regardless of Ki-67 index. Overall, the robust treatment beneﬁt of abemaciclib extended beyond the 2-year treatment period. Key words: abemaciclib, adjuvant, CDK4/6, early breast cancer, Ki-67

Annals of Oncology INTRODUCTION Since the introduction of aromatase inhibition in the early 2000s, there have been limited advancements to the standard (neo)adjuvant therapies available for patients with hormone receptor-positive (HRþ), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2) early breast cancer (EBC).1 While treatment optimizations including extended endocrine therapy (ET), ovarian suppression in premenopausal patients,2 and chemotherapy personalization based on clinicopathological and molecular features have further improved outcomes, unmet need exists for those at the highest risk of recurrence.3,4 Novel strategies are needed to improve outcomes for these patients. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4 and 6) inhibitors administered in combination with ET have markedly improved outcomes for patients with HRþ, HER2, advanced breast cancer.5-7 While small studies in the preoperative setting have also suggested potential activity of CDK4 and 6 inhibitors in EBC, the beneﬁt of these agents in the adjuvant setting remained unknown.8,9 To evaluate this important question, monarchE, an openlabel, global, phase III, randomized trial comparing adjuvant ET for at least 5 years with or without abemaciclib for 2 years, was conducted in patients with HRþ, HER2, node-positive, high-risk EBC. High risk was deﬁned by a compilation of clinical and pathologic factors including nodal status, tumor size, grade, and a marker of cellular proliferation (Ki-67). Ki-67 has previously been shown to be prognostic of clinical outcome in EBC,3,10 as well as a predictor of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or ET.11,12 In hormone-sensitive disease, prospective data demonstrated that suppression of Ki-67 in the setting of preoperative ET is prognostic for recurrence-free survival.12,13 Preoperative abemaciclib has also been shown to substantially lower Ki-67 expression, further suggesting CDK4 and 6 inhibition may be effective in tumors with a high degree of cellular proliferation.8 Therefore, in monarchE, Ki-67 expression was used together with clinicopathological features, to identify patients with a high risk of recurrence. Ki-67 20% was used to differentiate between low and high values according to the deﬁnition from the St Gallen International Expert Consensus.14 At a previous preplanned interim analysis, monarchE met its primary endpoint when abemaciclib þ ET demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in invasive diseasefree survival (IDFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population compared with ET alone.15 Here, we present updated results from two timepoints: (i) the prespeciﬁed primary outcome (PO) analysis and (ii) an additional follow-up analysis, conducted at regulatory request. Outcomes will also be reported from prespeciﬁed subpopulations based on Ki-67 levels. METHODS Study design and participants monarchE (Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT03155997) included women and men, with HRþ, HER2, EBC at high 1572

risk of recurrence according to clinicopathological features.15 Patients were assigned to one of two cohorts. Cohort 1 enrolled patients with either 4 positive axillary lymph nodes (ALNs), or 1-3 positive ALNs and at least one of the following: tumor size 5 cm or histologic grade 3. Cohort 2 started enrolling 1 year after cohort 1 and included patients with 1-3 positive ALNs, tumor size <5 cm, grade <3, and a centrally determined high Ki-67 index (20%). Ki67 index was also determined centrally in cohort 1 patients with a suitable breast tumor tissue sample, but Ki-67 determination was not required for enrollment. All patients were required to have radiographic staging between diagnosis and randomization. The inclusion criteria for selecting the patient population at high risk of recurrence were based on efﬁcacy outcome data from the West German Group (WSG) Plan B trial3 and the NSABP B-28 trial.16 Among a subset of the Plan B patient population who satisﬁed the monarchE criteria for high risk disease, the estimated 5-year IDFS rate was 82.5% [95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 77.8% to 87.2%], reﬂecting that approximately 17.5% of those patients who were at high risk of recurrence would develop recurrence events within the ﬁrst 5 years. This study, including all amendments, was approved by Institutional Review Boards and was conducted in accordance with consensus ethic principles derived from international ethic guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and the International Conference on HarmonisationGood Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) Guidelines. Treatment Patients were randomized (1 : 1) to receive adjuvant abemaciclib plus ET or ET alone for 2 years (treatment period), with ET prescribed for at least 5 years. Patients were stratiﬁed by prior chemotherapy, menopausal status at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, and region. Abemaciclib was administered orally at 150 mg twice daily. ET was administered per physician’s choice including antiestrogen agents (e.g. tamoxifen) or aromatase inhibitors, with or without a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist per standard practice. Further details about the randomization, stratiﬁcation, and other study procedures have been previously described.15 Ki-67 central assay Ki-67 index was determined centrally in all suitable untreated breast primary tumor samples using an investigational Ki-67 immunohistochemistry assay developed by Agilent Technologies (formerly Dako; Santa Clara, CA).17 The assay was carried out in formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tissue using the anti-Ki-67 antibody, MIB-1, and Negative Control Reagent in an automated platform. Results were interpreted using a light microscope by a certiﬁed pathologist using a standardized scoring algorithm involving the evaluation of the entire tissue slide. A cut-off of 20% was used to deﬁne high Ki-67 index. Volume 32 - Issue 12 - 2021

Outcomes The primary endpoint was IDFS per the Standardized Deﬁnitions for Efﬁcacy End Points in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trials (STEEP) criteria in the ITT population (cohorts 1 þ 2).18 Key secondary endpoints included distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), overall survival (OS), IDFS in the Ki-67 high population (both ITT and cohort 1), and safety. All patients who received at least one dose of study treatment were included in the safety analysis. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Statistical analyses The primary objective of IDFS in the ITT population was met at the second efﬁcacy interim analysis.15 A secondary objective was to test the superiority of abemaciclib þ ET versus ET alone in patients whose tumors had high Ki-67 index in both the ITT population as well as those enrolled in cohort 1. The overall type I error was controlled with gate-keeping strategy for IDFS in the ITT and Ki-67 high populations. The PO analysis was preplanned at w390 IDFS events, which was reached on 8 July 2020. At PO, IDFS in the ITT Ki67 high and cohort 1 Ki-67 high populations was tested sequentially, with two-sided P value boundaries of 0.0424 and 0.0426, respectively, calculated using the method of Slud and Wei.19 In addition, exploratory analyses evaluated IDFS in cohort 1 patients whose tumors had Ki-67 <20% (cohort 1 Ki-67 low), IDFS in cohort 2 patients, as well as DRFS in the Ki-67 subpopulations. An additional analysis was conducted in response to regulators, with a data cut-off date on 1 April 2021 (additional follow-up 1 [AFU1]) at which point the majority of patients had discontinued or completed the study treatment period. For efﬁcacy endpoints, a stratiﬁed Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the treatment effect hazard ratio (HR). Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all P values were reported using a two-sided alpha level and all CIs used a 95% level. Additionally, an exploratory analysis was carried out to estimate the piecewise yearly HR for IDFS and DRFS at AFU1. This analysis breaks the observation period into yearly time intervals and assesses treatment effect within each interval using a Bayesian piecewise exponential model. The reported 95% credible intervals (Crls) were calculated by equal tails in the posterior samples of the Bayesian exponential model. RESULTS A total of 5637 patients were randomized to receive abemaciclib þ ET (n ¼ 2808) or ET alone (n ¼ 2829) (Supplementary Figure S1, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015); of those, 5120 were enrolled in cohort 1. Some 44.3% of all randomized patients and 39.1% of patients in cohort 1 had tumors with high Ki-67 index. Within cohort 1, 37.4% of patients had tumors with low Ki-67 index and 23.5% of patients had unavailable Ki-67 Volume 32 - Issue 12 - 2021 

Annals of Oncology index (Supplementary Figure S2, available at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015). Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms in the ITT and ITT Ki67-high populations (Table 1). In cohort 1, the frequency of grade 3 tumors was higher in patients with Ki-67-high tumors, while the proportion of patients with 4 positive lymph nodes was higher in the Ki-67-low population (Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015). Supplementary Figure S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015, demonstrates the percentages of patients in cohort 1 with Ki-67-high and -low tumors within each clinicopathological feature. From the preplanned PO analysis (data cut-off: 8 July 2020) to AFU1 (data cut-off: 1 April 2021), the median follow-up increased from 19 to 27 months. The percentage of patients who were off the study treatment period increased from 40.9% at PO to 89.6% at AFU1, including 4071 (72.2%) who completed the 2-year treatment period and 982 (17.4%) who discontinued prematurely (Supplementary Figure S1, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015). Efﬁcacy data from both PO and AFU1 are presented to show the evolution of the treatment effect over time (Table 2). Efﬁcacy Efﬁcacy in the ITT population (PO, median follow-up 19 months). After reaching statistical signiﬁcance at the interim analysis, abemaciclib þ ET continued to demonstrate clinically meaningful beneﬁt in IDFS with a greater magnitude of effect size at PO (Table 2; HR ¼ 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.87; nominal P < 0.001). There was also an absolute improvement of 3.0% in the 2-year IDFS rates (abemaciclib þ ET: 92.3% versus ET alone: 89.3%). Similarly, abemaciclib þ ET continued to demonstrate clinically meaningful beneﬁt in DRFS (Table 2; HR ¼ 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.86; nominal P < 0.001), corresponding to an absolute difference of 3.0% at 2 years (abemaciclib þ ET: 93.8% versus ET alone: 90.8%). Efﬁcacy in the ITT population (AFU1, median follow-up 27 months). With 8 months of additional median follow-up, the beneﬁt of abemaciclib þ ET was maintained for IDFS (Table 2; HR ¼ 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.82; nominal P < 0.0001) and DRFS (Table 2; HR ¼ 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.83; nominal P < 0.0001). The KaplaneMeier (KM) curves (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S4A, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015) continued to show the beneﬁt of abemaciclib, even beyond the 2-year study treatment period. With more patients at risk for recurrence at 3 years, the data demonstrated an absolute improvement of 5.4% for 3-year IDFS rates (abemaciclib þ ET: 88.8% versus ET alone: 83.4%) and 4.2% for 3-year DRFS rates (abemaciclib þ ET: 90.3% versus ET alone: 86.1%). Treatment beneﬁt in IDFS and DRFS was generally consistent across prespeciﬁed subgroups (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure S4B, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015

Bone and liver were the most common sites of distant recurrence with fewer recurrences in the abemaciclib arm (Supplementary Table S2, available at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015). OS data remained immature as the required number of events was not reached at the time of this analysis. The piecewise HR estimates within each year for IDFS demonstrated increasing magnitude of effect size over time: from the ﬁrst year (0-1 year HR ¼ 0.80, 95% CrI 0.59-1.03) to the second year (1-2 year HR ¼ 0.68, 95% CrI 0.52-0.87), and strengthened beyond the 2-year study treatment period (2þ year HR ¼ 0.60, 95% CrI 0.40-0.86). Similarly, 1574

At AFU1, the clinically meaningful beneﬁt in IDFS was of greater magnitude (Figure 2A; HR ¼ 0.66, 95% CI 0.52-0.84; nominal P ¼ 0.0006), with an absolute improvement of 6.0% in 3-year IDFS rates. Consistently, there was a 36% reduction in the risk of developing a DRFS event (Supplementary Table S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015; HR ¼ 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.83; nominal P ¼ 0.0006) with an absolute improvement of 4.0% in the 3-year DRFS rates. Efﬁcacy in the cohort 1 Ki-67-high and -low populations. At PO, abemaciclib þ ET signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of developing an IDFS event in the prespeciﬁed, alphacontrolled, cohort 1 Ki-67-high population by 36% (HR ¼ 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.87; two-sided P ¼ 0.0042). The 2-year IDFS rates were 91.3% in abemaciclib þ ET and 86.1% in ET alone, with an absolute improvement of 5.2% at PO. Similarly, abemaciclib beneﬁt was observed in the cohort 1 Ki-67-low population, with 31% reduction in the risk of developing an IDFS event (HR ¼ 0.69, 95% CI 0.46-1.02; nominal P ¼ 0.059) and an absolute difference in 2-year IDFS rate of 2.8% (94.8% in abemaciclib þ ET and 92.0% in ET alone). At AFU1, analyses of Ki-67 subpopulations in cohort 1 showed consistent results with PO. The clinically meaningful beneﬁt in IDFS and DRFS in the cohort 1 Ki-67-high population was maintained (Figure 2B; IDFS HR ¼ 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.80; nominal P ¼ 0.0002 and Supplementary Table S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015; DRFS HR ¼ 0.60, 95% CI 0.46-0.79; nominal P ¼ 0.0002), with an absolute improvement of 7.1% and 5.2% in 3-year IDFS and DRFS rates, respectively. Numerical beneﬁt was also observed in the cohort 1 Ki-67-low population (IDFS HR ¼ 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.98; nominal P ¼ 0.036), suggesting that abemaciclib þ ET resulted in an IDFS beneﬁt regardless of the Ki-67 index in cohort 1 (Figure 3). In addition, the 3-year IDFS rates in the control arm suggested Volume 32 - Issue 12 - 2021 

that patients with Ki-67-high tumors had a higher risk of developing an IDFS event than those with Ki-67-low tumors (79.0% versus 87.2%, respectively), thus indicating the prognostic value of Ki-67 in this patient population. The data for IDFS in cohort 2 remained immature. Safety At AFU1, the median duration of abemaciclib and ET in both arms was 24 months. A higher incidence of grade 3 AEs and serious AEs was observed with abemaciclib þ ET versus ET alone (50% versus 16% and 15% versus 9%, respectively). The most frequent AEs were diarrhea, neutropenia, and fatigue in the abemaciclib arm, and arthralgia, hot ﬂush, and fatigue in the control arm (Supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015). In total, 181 patients (6.5%) in the abemaciclib þ ET arm and 30 patients (1.1%) in the control arm discontinued from the 2-year study treatment period due to AEs. DISCUSSION At the prespeciﬁed PO analysis of monarchE, with a median follow-up of 19 months and 41% of patients off study treatment, abemaciclib þ ET reduced the risk of developing an IDFS event by 29%. At the AFU1, with a longer median follow-up of 27 months and 90% of patients having completed or discontinued from the study treatment period, the beneﬁt of abemaciclib þ ET was conﬁrmed in terms of IDFS (30% risk reduction) and DRFS (31% risk reduction). The separation of the KM curves, in addition to the increasing magnitude of yearly piecewise HR estimates, demonstrates the continued treatment beneﬁt over time that extended beyond the 2-year treatment period of abemaciclib. The observed improvement in IDFS to date reﬂects abemaciclib was efﬁcacious in preventing early recurrence in patients with primary resistance to ET as deﬁned by https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015

Collectively, these data suggest that 2 years of abemaciclib treatment provide a meaningful beneﬁt for this patient population. A 2-year abemaciclib treatment duration was selected to manage patients through their period of highest relapse-risk while simultaneously balancing the risk potential for side-effects.21 Further follow-up is needed to determine the impact of adjuvant abemaciclib on later recurrences. OS data remained immature and follow-up for survival outcomes is ongoing. Given the substantial reduction in the risk of developing invasive disease as well as distant recurrence and the maintenance of the treatment beneﬁt over time, it is anticipated that the robust treatment beneﬁt will translate to survival beneﬁt. Two phase III studies investigating palbociclib, another CDK4 and 6 inhibitor, in patients with HRþ, HER2 EBC Volume 32 - Issue 12 - 2021 

have recently reported no improvement in IDFS with the addition of adjuvant palbociclib to ET.22,23 PALLAS enrolled 5760 patients with stage II-III disease and Penelope-B enrolled 1250 patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a clinical pathological stagingestrogen receptor grading score of 3, or score ¼ 2 and tumor involvement in lymph nodes. The reasons for the differences in outcomes between these studies and monarchE are unclear. While the studies enrolled patients with different risks of recurrence, there was no numerical beneﬁt in the subgroup of high-risk patients (58.7%) in PALLAS deﬁned as having 4 positive nodes or 1-3 positive nodes with either T3/T4 and/or grade 3 disease. The treatment durations with the CDK4 and 6 inhibitors also differed between Penelope-B (1 year) and monarchE and PALLAS (2 years). In Penelope-B, the observed numerical difference https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015

favoring the palbociclib arm in the IDFS rates (4.3% and 3.5% at 2 and 3 years, respectively) was not sustained over time and the study did not show a statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁt. It remains unknown if the early separation of the IDFS KM curves reﬂected a transient treatment effect from palbociclib that diminished over time or could be attributed to statistical variability related to a small number of events at the earlier timepoints. In monarchE, the treatment beneﬁt of abemaciclib þ ET was statistically signiﬁcant and clinically meaningful. This beneﬁt was maintained over time and extended beyond the 2-year study treatment period. Another potential explanation for the discordant outcomes to date for monarchE, PALLAS, and Penelope-B are the differences between drugs. Whereas abemaciclib is administered continuously daily, palbociclib is administered daily for 3 weeks followed by 1-week rest. In preclinical studies, abemaciclib has shown a tolerability proﬁle that allows for a continuous dosing required for sustainable G1/S arrest and inhibition of tumor growth.24,25 In addition, continuous inhibition of CDK4 and 6 by abemaciclib led to cell senescence and apoptosis to a greater extent than was seen with palbociclib.25,26 It can be speculated that the differences in mechanism of action and the continuous versus intermittent dosing schedules may be more important in eradicating micrometastatic cells in an adjuvant setting, as opposed to established macrometastatic disease where both abemaciclib and palbociclib have shown relatively similar anticancer activity in regard to progression-free survival. Differences, 1578 

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.015 

however, in OS beneﬁt between abemaciclib and palbociclib have also been observed in the metastatic setting in combination with fulvestrant in patients who progressed after prior ET.Whereas palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant failed to show signiﬁcant OS differences in the ITT population,27 abemaciclib plus fulvestrant demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant OS beneﬁt in the ITT population.28 The use of Ki-67 in clinical practice is historically challenging due to the high inter-observer variability and the lack of a standard threshold for determining high versus low values.29 In monarchE, Ki-67 was measured at a central laboratory using a validated assay that was shown to be highly reproducible across different pathologists and laboratories using an automated staining protocol with a standardized scoring method.17 This is the ﬁrst phase III registration trial that has prospectively analyzed the utility of a prespeciﬁed, centrally conﬁrmed Ki-67 threshold of 20% using a standardized assay and methodology. Abemaciclib þ ET signiﬁcantly improved IDFS in patients with Ki-67-high tumors in the ITT and cohort 1 populations. Within cohort 1, the beneﬁt of abemaciclib was consistently observed regardless of Ki-67 index, suggesting Ki-67 is not predictive of abemaciclib treatment beneﬁt. Because patients in cohort 1 with Ki67-high tumors had a greater risk of recurrence than those with Ki-67-low tumors, we concluded that Ki-67 index was prognostic of recurrence. Overall, these data support use of Ki-67 20% together with high-risk Volume 32 - Issue 12 - 2021

clinicopathological features to identify patients with an even greater risk of recurrence. In conclusion, adjuvant abemaciclib combined with ET showed statistically signiﬁcant and clinically meaningful improvement in IDFS for patients with HRþ, HER2, nodepositive, high-risk, EBC. Ki-67 index was a prognostic factor for recurrence in this treatment setting but was not predictive of the treatment effect with abemaciclib beneﬁt being observed regardless of Ki-67 status. With 27 months median follow-up, abemaciclib þ ET continued to provide a clinically meaningful beneﬁt in IDFS and DRFS that extended beyond the 2-year treatment period, with a tolerable and manageable safety proﬁle.
