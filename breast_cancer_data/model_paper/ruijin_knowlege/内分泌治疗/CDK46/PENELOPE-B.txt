Palbociclib for Residual High-Risk Invasive HR-Positive and HER2-Negative Early Breast Cancer—The Penelope-B Trial 

abstract 

PURPOSE About one third of patients with hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative breast cancer who have residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) will relapse. Thus, additional therapy is needed. Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor demonstrating efﬁcacy in the metastatic setting.

PATIENTS AND METHODS PENELOPE-B (NCT01864746) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study in women with hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative primary breast cancer without a pathological complete response after taxane-containing NACT and at high risk of relapse (clinical pathological staging-estrogen receptor grading score $ 3 or 2 and ypN1). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 13 cycles of palbociclib 125 mg once daily or placebo on days 1-21 in a 28-day cycle in addition to endocrine therapy (ET). Primary end point is invasive disease-free survival (iDFS). Final analysis was planned after 290 iDFS events with a two-sided efﬁcacy boundary P , .0463 because of two interim analyses. RESULTS One thousand two hundred ﬁfty patients were randomly assigned. The median age was 49.0 years (range, 19-79), and the majority were ypN1 with Ki-67 # 15%; 59.4% of patients had a clinical pathological staging-estrogen receptor grading score $ 3. 50.1% received aromatase inhibitor, and 33% of premenopausal women received a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog in addition to either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. After a median follow-up of 42.8 months (92% complete), 308 events were conﬁrmed. Palbociclib did not improve iDFS versus placebo added to ET-stratiﬁed hazard ratio, 0.93 (95% repeated CI, 0.74 to 1.17) and two-sided weighted log-rank test (Cui, Hung, and Wang) P 5 .525. There was no difference among the subgroups. Most common related serious adverse events were infections and vascular disorders in 113 (9.1%) patients with no difference between the treatment arms. Eight fatal serious adverse events (two palbociclib and six placebo) were reported. CONCLUSION Palbociclib for 1 year in addition to ET did not improve iDFS in women with residual invasive disease after NACT.

INTRODUCTION Patients with hormone receptor–positive (HR1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HER22) primary breast cancer who receive chemotherapy as part of their primary treatment are at higher risk of relapse.1 About a third of the patients with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) will relapse despite adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET).2 The risk of relapse can be assessed more accurately using the clinical pathological staging-estrogen receptor grading (CPS-EG) 

scoring system.3 This involves the tumor stage before treatment start and at surgery, the estrogen receptor (ER) status, and the pathologic grading. A higher score indicates a higher risk of relapse. Patients with a score of three and higher had a diseasefree survival of 70% at 5 years despite receiving ET. When combined with the group having a CPS-EG score of two and involved lymph nodes, the diseasefree survival increased to 77%. This group comprises about 25% of all patients with residual disease after NACT.4

Palbociclib for Residual Invasive HR1 and HER22 Breast Cancer 

CONTEXT Key Objective Patients with hormone receptor–positive (HR1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HER22) breast cancer and residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are at high risk for relapse despite adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET). The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor palbociclib added to ET improves progressionfree survival and overall survival in HR1 and HER22 metastatic breast cancer. PENELOPE-B assesses efﬁcacy of one year palbociclib versus placebo added to ET as (postneo)adjuvant treatment in this high-risk population. Knowledge Generated Palbociclib (1 year) added to ET did not improve invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) or any other efﬁcacy end point compared with placebo (3-year iDFS, 81.2% v 77.7%). No new safety signals were observed. Relevance PENELOPE-B is the ﬁrst study showing mature iDFS results on a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor as part of (postneo)adjuvant therapy. The results do not support the addition of palbociclib to ET. Further research and pooled analyses are necessary to determine whether a high-risk HR1, HER22 population can be identiﬁed, which has a sustained long-term reduction of relapse from palbociclib. 

Therapeutic inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) by palbociclib combined with ET demonstrated clinically relevant efﬁcacy in metastatic HR1 and HER22 breast cancer irrespective of biomarker selection.5 After the pivotal PALOMA-1 trial, which led to accelerated approval of palbociclib in February 2015, further phase III trials demonstrated that the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in pre- and postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive or resistant cancers, in ﬁrst-line and pretreated metastatic breast cancer, improves progression-free and overall survival (OS).6-8 Thus, we hypothesized that palbociclib may also be active in patients with residual disease after NACT who are at high risk of relapse. Based on the data from PALOMA-1, we designed the PENELOPE-B trial assessing the efﬁcacy of one year palbociclib vs placebo added to any ET in HR1 and HER22 breast cancer patients with residual disease and high risk after NACT, based on the CPS-EG score. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient Selection and Study Design PENELOPE-B is a prospective, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled phase III study investigating the addition of palbociclib for one year to standard adjuvant ET for patients with high-risk residual disease according to the CPS-EG score after NACT for early HR1 and HER22 breast cancer. The trial was sponsored by GBG Forschungs GmbH in collaboration with NSABP Foundation (plus I-SPY and CCTR), ABCSG, AGO-B, ANBCSG, BIG, Geicam, ICR-CTSU, JBCSG, and KCSG. Pﬁzer Inc funded the trial and provided drug. The trial was conducted according to ICH-GCP guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. The clinical trial Protocol (online only) was approved by the respective health authorities and ethics committees or institutional review 

boards. All patients provided written informed consent for trial participation, data transfer, and biomaterial collection. The trial was overseen by the International Steering Committee and the GBG Boards and supervised by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). It is registered under NCT01864746 and EudraCT 2013-001040-62. Female patients $ 18 years with residual invasive disease after NACT either in the breast or the lymph nodes, ER, and/ or progesterone receptor–positive and HER22 tumors based on central assessment and centrally assessed Ki-67 status (preferably on postneoadjuvant residual invasive disease of the breast, or if not possible, of residual nodal invasion or core biopsy), and a CPS-EG score of $ 3 or 2 with ypN1 (after amendment 3, dated February 9, 2015) were eligible. Patients must have received NACT for at least 16 weeks (including 6 weeks of a taxane) followed by deﬁnitive surgery (including resection of all clinically evident invasive disease and ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel node biopsy) and radiation as indicated according to local guidelines. Patients could not be included with an interval of more than 16 weeks since the date of ﬁnal surgery or more than 10 weeks from completing radiotherapy. ET according to local guidelines, either with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) with or without a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog, could have started before random assignment. ER and progesterone receptor positivity were deﬁned as $ 1% stained cells, and HER2 negativity as immunohistochemistry score 0-1 or ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridization test ratio , 2.0. Further eligibility criteria and random assignment details are provided in Appendix 1 (online only). Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner in permuted blocks of alternating size 4/6 stratiﬁed by risk status (CPS-EG sore $ 3 v 2/ypN1), nodal involvement

Palbociclib for Residual Invasive HR1 and HER22 Breast Cancer 

after surgery (ypN0-1 v ypN2-3), Ki-67 (# 15% v . 15%), age (# 50 v . 50 years), and global region of participating site (Asian v non-Asian). Treatment Patients received either palbociclib 125 mg orally once daily for 21 days followed by 1 week off treatment for a total duration of 13 4-week cycles or matching placebo in addition to standard adjuvant ET at the discretion of the investigator given for at least 5 years (Data Supplement, Supplementary Fig 1 [online only]). Dose interruptions, reductions, or delays according to predeﬁned toxicity management were acceptable in the case of signiﬁcant treatment-related toxicity (Appendix 1). Objectives and End Points The primary objective of the study was to compare the invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) deﬁned as the time in months between random assignment and ﬁrst event (ipsilateral invasive in-breast or locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer, second primary invasive cancer [nonbreast], or death because of any cause) for palbociclib versus placebo.9 Secondary end points included iDFS excluding second primary invasive nonbreast cancers, distant disease-free survival, OS, locoregional relapse-free interval (LRRFI), safety (which was reported as adverse events (AEs) irrespective of relatedness to study treatment based on National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria v4.0), and compliance. Further details on other end points are provided in the Appendix 1. All time-to-event end points were analyzed in the intent-totreat population comprising all randomly assigned patients. Compliance and safety were analyzed in the safety analysis set including all randomly assigned patients who took study medication at least once. For the patients randomly assigned to placebo who received palbociclib at least once during the trial, the treatment group allocation for safety and compliance analyses was the palbociclib arm. 

Sample Size and Interim Analyses In the initial sample size computation, 233 iDFS events were required to detect a hazard ratio for palbociclib/ placebo of 0.67 (from 72% to 80% 3-year iDFS rate) corresponding to a clinically relevant risk reduction of 33% for invasive disease with a power of 85% using a two-sided stratiﬁed log-rank test and an overall two-sided signiﬁcance level of 0.05. Eight hundred patients were planned to be enrolled. To accelerate recruitment after 68 patients had been enrolled, the population was expanded to patients with a CPS-EG score of two and ypN 1 who were also identiﬁed as high-risk patients but with a generally lower risk than the patients with CPS-EG three.4 Thereafter, the target hazard ratio for palbociclib/placebo was updated to 0.685 (from 77% to 83.6% 3-year iDFS rate), and the iDFS events were increased to 255 and sample size to 1,100 patients. The study had an adaptive design with two interim efﬁcacy analyses to monitor futility, to test for overwhelming efﬁcacy, and to allow for sample size re-estimation.10 Safety was assessed at both interim analyses. O’Brien and Fleming11 type stopping boundaries based on the Lan-DeMets spending function were used in the interim analyses. The ﬁrst interim analysis in April 2017 with 67 events led to another increase of the required number of events to 290 and of the patient number to 1,250 according to the IDMC recommendation. The second interim analysis was conducted based on 200 events (194 events planned) in April 2019, neither futility nor overwhelming efﬁcacy boundaries were crossed, and the study continued per IDMC recommendation. Statistical Analysis Final analysis of the primary end point iDFS was planned after 290 iDFS events with a nominal signiﬁcance level of 0.0463 (two-sided). To address the concern of possible inﬂation of the type I error because of the sample size increase, statistical signiﬁcance was determined using a weighted statistic of the stratiﬁed log-rank test (stratiﬁed by risk status, nodal involvement after surgery, Ki-67, age, but

analysis were used for time-to-event end points (except LRRFI) to report hazard ratios with 95% CI. LRRFI was analyzed using the cumulative incidence function for rates at speciﬁc time points with stratiﬁed Gray’s test for comparison and stratiﬁed univariate Fine-Gray model to report hazard ratio for treatment. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare frequencies of AEs between arms. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4 with SAS Enterprise Guide Version 7.1 on Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise. Data cutoff date was August 24, 2020. RESULTS Patients and Treatment Between February 2014 and December 2017, 1,708 patients were screened and 1,250 patients were randomly assigned in 221 sites and 11 countries to receive either palbociclib or placebo plus ET. One thousand two hundred forty-four patients started therapy, 628 in the palbociclib arm and 616 in the placebo arm (Fig 1). The baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the treatment arms (Table 1). The median age was 49 (range, 19-79) years. One hundred ninety-ﬁve of 1,250 (15.6%) were younger than 40 years. The majority were enrolled with a CPS-EG score of three and higher (59.4%) and had a Ki-67 # 15% (74.5%). Almost all patients had received an anthracycline-taxane–based chemotherapy (98.6%) and adjuvant radiotherapy (98.8%) and had already started ET before enrollment (89.4%). Tamoxifen (49.8%) or AI (50.2%) with or without a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist was equally used as ﬁrst type of ET and was comparable between treatment arms (Table 1), but differed by menopausal status (Appendix Table A1, online only). Tamoxifen was the preferred ﬁrst ET in premenopausal 

After a median follow-up of 42.8 months (92% complete),13 308 conﬁrmed iDFS events (24.6%) were documented, 152 (24.1%) in the palbociclib arm and 156 (25.2%) in the placebo arm. Most iDFS events were distant recurrences (227 [73.7%]), and locoregional events were reported in 48 patients (15.6%) (Table 2). There was no difference between the two treatment arms (stratiﬁed hazard ratio 0.93 [95% repeated CI, 0.74 to 1.17], P [CHW] 5 .525). The estimated 3-year iDFS was 81.2% (77.8%-84.1%) with palbociclib and 77.7% (74.1%-80.9%) with placebo (Fig 2A). No subgroup could be identiﬁed, which beneﬁtted from the addition of palbociclib to ET after NACT (Fig 2B). The analysis of iDFS excluding second primary invasive nonbreast cancers showed a similar result (hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.16]; P 5 .501). LRRFI was not signiﬁcantly different between the two arms. The locoregional recurrence cumulative incidence rate at 3 years was 3.7% (95% CI, 2.4% to 5.4%) with palbociclib and 4.6% (95% CI, 3.1% to 6.5%) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.49 to 1.39]; P 5 .514). The only subgroup that seems to beneﬁt from palbociclib in terms of LRRFI was the group without response to NACT (stable or progressive disease, n 5 200, hazard ratio, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.95]; P 5 .043 [Data Supplement, Supplementary Fig 2]). At the time of ﬁnal iDFS analysis, an interim analysis for OS was performed with 131 deaths reported. OS was not signiﬁcantly different between the two arms (hazard ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.23]; P 5 .420) with no differences according to subgroups. The 3-year OS was 93.6% (91.3%-95.3%) with palbociclib and 90.5% (87.8%92.6%) with placebo (Fig 3). Safety and Compliance One thousand two hundred forty-four patients who started therapy, 633 with palbociclib and 611 with placebo, comprised the safety set. All patients except one in each treatment arm reported at least one AE. At least one grade 3-4 AE was signiﬁcantly more often reported in the palbociclib group compared with the placebo group (79.6% v 20.1%). There was no difference between nonhematologic grade 3-4 AEs between the treatment groups (19.9% v 19.0%), but there were signiﬁcantly more hematologic grade 3-4 AEs with palbociclib compared with placebo (73.1% v 1.3%). The most frequent AEs with a signiﬁcantly higher incidence in the palbociclib arm were neutropenia of any grade (95.7% v 23.4%) and grade 3-4 (70.0% v 1.0%), leukopenia any grade (99.2% v 69.9%) and grade 3-4 (56.1% v 0.7%), thrombocytopenia any grade (56.6% v 16.2%), anemia any grade (73.9% v 30.3%), hypocalcaemia any grade (35.2% v 24.4%), fatigue any grade (66.4% v 51.1%), stomatitis any grade

Arthralgia (41.2% v 46.8%) and hot ﬂushes (43.8% v 50.9%) were less frequent with palbociclib than placebo (Table 3). Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (9.1%) patients, with no difference between treatment arms; eight were fatal, two in the palbociclib arm (cardiogenic shock and inﬂuenza, both not related to study drug) and six in the placebo arm (leukemia, myeloid leukemia, hepatorenal failure, lung embolism, and two cases of sudden death because of unknown reasons). Overall, 219 (17.5%) patients discontinued study treatment (n 5 38, 3.0% because of toxicity) and 64 (5.1%) discontinued ET prematurely. 301 patients (47.6%) in the palbociclib arm compared with 11 patients (1.8%) in the placebo arm had at least one dose reduction (P , .001). In the last cycle, 256 patients (49.7%) still received 125 mg palbociclib, but 512 (98.5%) received full dose in the placebo arm (Data Supplement, Supplementary Fig 3). Thirteen cycles were completed by 80.5% versus 84.5% with palbociclib and placebo, respectively (Fig 1). The median duration of therapy was 52.9 weeks with palbociclib and 52.0 weeks with placebo (P , .001). The relative total dose intensity was signiﬁcantly lower with palbociclib (82.1% v 98.9%, P , .001). DISCUSSION The PENELOPE-B trial failed to demonstrate that the addition of 1 year palbociclib to standard ET improved iDFS compared with placebo in a speciﬁc high-risk HR1/ HER22 primary breast cancer population. All patients were 

considered to be at high risk to receive NACT. Almost all patients received adjuvant radiotherapy, underlining the high-risk nature of this population. The 3-year iDFS was 81.2% with palbociclib and 77.7% with placebo, with an absolute difference of 3.5%. At 2 years, the absolute difference was 4.3%. Although there is no statistical evidence for a difference in the two arms, further analyses should elucidate potential early effects of the therapy. Long-term follow-up of the other CDK4/6 inhibitor trials will show whether there is evidence for time-dependent efﬁcacy as hypothesized in the PENELOPE-B trial, enrolling high-risk postneoadjuvant patients. It can be argued that palbociclib might delay relapses rather than sustaining a long-term effect, so 1 year of therapy may be too short and in retrospect two or more years of CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy may be needed. About 20% of the patients in the PENELOPE-B trial, the only double-blind, placebo controlled phase III trial, did not complete 13 cycles and stopped treatment prematurely, whereas in a feasibility study, 37%14 and in PALLAS, 42% of patients did not complete 2 years of adjuvant palbociclib.15 In monarchE, 16% stopped abemaciclib because of AEs, and this rate was lower in PENELOPE-B.16 In the KATHERINE trial for HER2-positive breast cancer, 31% of the patients did not complete 14 cycles of therapy.17 This is a heavily pretreated population, and despite the high-risk status of the patients and the proven efﬁcacy in the metastatic setting, the persistence with therapy in the adjuvant setting is lower than that in metastatic breast cancer.18 The initially more conservative AE management was adapted to try to maintain a higher relative total dose intensity, and with more than 80%, this is acceptable.19 The safety results in

the study were as expected. Interestingly, the rate of menopausal symptoms was lower with palbociclib, namely, hot ﬂushes and arthralgia. This had also been reported in other CDK4/6 inhibitor trials and seems to be a real positive side effect of CDK4/6 inhibitors.14,20 Another explanation for the results could be that most patients had a low Ki-67 at surgery: Ki-67 above 15% was present in 25.5% and above 25% in only 14% of the patients. At ﬁrst diagnosis (core biopsy), Ki-67 was high in three quarters of patients, showing that the low postoperative Ki-67 is a selection bias as the high-proliferating cells respond to chemotherapy. In the group with the higher Ki-67, 47% of the patients had a relapse versus only 21% in the group with a low Ki-67. However, the subgroup analysis does not suggest a differential effect for patients with high Ki-67 tumors. In fact, patients with luminal A tumors, with low Ki-67, show the same beneﬁt when CDK4/6 inhibitors were used as neoadjuvant therapy.21 When the PENELOPE-B trial was designed, we discussed selecting a population with high Ki-67 based on previous data.22 In the PENELOPE-B trial, Ki-67 was the strongest prognostic factor in multivariable analysis (data not shown), emphasizing the importance of the marker. The CPS-EG score, however, was demonstrated to be a stronger independent prognostic factor and a better discriminator between lowrisk and high-risk patients with residual disease and was therefore chosen as the primary inclusion criterion.4 Biomarker analysis, that is, deﬁned by gene expression analysis, is ongoing and might help to identify a subgroup beneﬁting from the addition of palbociclib to ET.23 None of the prespeciﬁed subgroup analysis reveals a group clearly beneﬁtting from palbociclib. The subgroup results for locoregional relapse seem to be counterintuitive, but the interaction test is clearly negative and the results should not be overinterpreted. At the time of the trial conception, only premature data from PALOMA-1 were available. The study was opened in December 2013 and started recruitment in February 2014, before registration of the drug. On this basis with limited 

safety data, the high-risk population and 1 year of therapy were chosen to justify the potential added toxicity, which in retrospect might have been too short. Other postneoadjuvant trials in HR1 and HER22 patients also failed to improve outcome. Capecitabine in CREATE-X seemed to be beneﬁcial in triple-negative breast cancer only.24 The NATAN trial with zoledronic acid given for 5 years in addition to ET in patients with residual disease after NACT did not improve outcome.25 Postneoadjuvant patients were also enrolled in the two large adjuvant studies, but without further deﬁning the risk status. In contrast to the PALLAS trial, the monarchE study showed an improvement in iDFS by adding abemaciclib to ET after a median followup of 14 months. The subgroup analysis also revealed a clear beneﬁt at this early time point for the patients who received NACT.13,14 Strengths of this study are the placebo-controlled design, the clear hypothesis, which was generated based on the GBG database, and the selection of patients based on these data. HER2, hormone receptor status, and Ki-67 were centrally assessed. With a 43-month follow-up, this is the most mature early breast cancer CDK4/6 inhibitor study. The completeness of follow-up is 92%, demonstrating the high quality and robustness of the data. The control arm often improves over time and invalidates the initial study hypothesis; however, in PENELOPE-B, the control arm performed close to that estimated with an iDFS at 3 years of 77%. In conclusion, the PENELOPE-B trial did not demonstrate that the addition of one year palbociclib to standard adjuvant ET improves iDFS in patients at high risk of relapse after NACT deﬁned by the CPS-EG score. Further research is warranted by pooling the data from this speciﬁc population enrolled in PENELOPE-B with other trials to determine whether this group has a sustained long-term reduction of relapse from a CDK4/6 inhibitor and to characterize this population by molecular markers. This will take some time, as the follow-up from these trials is either too short or recruitment is still ongoing.

Relative total dose intensity (RTDI) is the total dose intensity within the entire treatment achieved by a patient relative to intended dose intensity based on the planned schedule of the treatment. RTDI was calculated according to the following step-by-step algorithm: Planned dose is the amount of a drug planned to be given in a cycle. Planned total dose is the planned cumulative dose over the entire treatment duration, ie, if a patient was planned to receive n cycles of drug, then sum the total amount of drug planned during those n cycles, n

Planned total dose intensity (PTDI) is the planned average dose intensity over the entire treatment duration, ie; 

PTDI ðmg=wkÞ 5 

PTD : planned duration of therapy ðwkÞ 

Actual dose is the total amount of drug that the patient has received over one cycle. Actual total dose (ATD) is the cumulative dose of the drug that has been given over the treatment duration of n cycles, n

Note that RTDI expresses the effect of reductions, interruptions, and delays and premature discontinuation of a treatment. For patients who die during study treatment or who discontinue study treatment because of disease relapse or second primary invasive nonbreast cancers, in the calculation of the planned total dose and the planned total dose intensity, the planned number of weeks of the last cycle and remaining cycles was equal to the number of weeks actually completed and the remaining cycles were not counted. For all other patients who discontinued treatment prematurely, the actual dose of the remaining weeks was considered zero doses without delay. Available dose levels are as follows:

Palbociclib for Residual Invasive HR1 and HER22 Breast Cancer 

Method for sample size re-estimation. The study design in the PENELOPEB trial included the possibility of a sample size re-estimation (SSR) to increase the number of events based on the result of the ﬁrst interim analysis. For the decision about the SSR, the promising zone10 for the possible outcomes of the interim analysis was deﬁned based on conditional power (the probability of achieving statistical signiﬁcance at the end of the trial, given the interim analysis’ result) to be ranging from 30% conditional power (lower limit) to 85% conditional power (upper limit). In case the results of the ﬁrst interim analysis fall in the promising zone, it was planned to perform a ﬁxed sample size increase to a predeﬁned maximum 

number of events, to prevent reverse engineering, the possibility to back calculate the interim analysis treatment effect on the basis of the increase of events. An upper limit of approximately 14% increase from the planned number of 255 events to a maximum number of 290 events was deﬁned, corresponding to a maximum sample size of 1,250 patients. The ﬁrst interim analysis was performed by an unblinded statistician providing the results to the Independent Data Monitoring Committee where the decision about the SSR was made based on predeﬁned rules determined in the Independent Data Monitoring Committee charter. The study team remained blinded to the interim result.
