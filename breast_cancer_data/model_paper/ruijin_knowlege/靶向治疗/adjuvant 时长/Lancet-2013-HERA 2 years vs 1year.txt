Summary Background Trastuzumab has established eﬃcacy against breast cancer with overexpression or ampliﬁcation of the HER2 oncogene. The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown. We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial. Methods The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events. The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0–10) is also reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032. Findings We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·99, 95% CI 0·85–1·14, p=0·86). Grade 3–4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20·4%] vs 275 [16·3%] grade 3–4 adverse events, and 120 [7·2%] vs 69 [4·1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively). HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0·76 (95% CI 0·67–0·86, p<0·0001) for disease-free survival and 0·76 (0·65–0·88, p=0·0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy. Interpretation 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more eﬀective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. 1 year of treatment provides a signiﬁcant disease-free and overall survival beneﬁt compared with observation and remains the standard of care.

Introduction About 15–20% of breast cancers exhibit overexpression or ampliﬁcation of the HER2 oncogene. Trastuzumab substantially reduces disease recurrence and death in patients with this type of early breast cancer and is now used widely in the adjuvant setting. Initial trials compared 1 year of trastuzumab treatment with a no trastuzumab control group.1–3 Further follow-up conﬁrmed a persistent beneﬁt of 1 year of treatment compared with observation alone.4–6 The HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial is unique in that it also included randomisation of patients to 2 years of trastuzumab to allow comparison of two diﬀerent durations of treatment. We report the ﬁrst results of the comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, and update the www.thelancet.com Vol 382 September 21, 2013

Methods Study design and participants The HERA trial design, eligibility criteria, randomisation, treatment plan, follow-up and monitoring, and statistical analyses have been described elsewhere.1,5 Brieﬂy, between Dec 7, 2001, and June 20, 2005, a total of 5102 patients were randomly allocated to three groups: observation, trastuzumab for 1 year, and trastuzumab for 2 years. All patients included had locally assessed HER2-positive early-stage invasive breast cancer conﬁrmed by the central laboratory (in Kassel, Germany), and left ventricular ejection fraction

(LVEF) of 55% or higher after completion of chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab is based on a 12-month landmark analysis of the 3105 women who remained alive and disease-free for at least 12 months (366 days) after randomisation to one of the two trastuzumab treatment groups. Open-label trastuzumab was administered intravenously at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 1 year or 2 years. Also presented in this report is an updated comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation based on 3399 patients enrolled in the two groups, with use of an intention-totreat analysis from the time of randomisation. All patients gave written, informed consent. The study protocol was approved by ethics review boards at all participating centres. 

Randomisation and masking Random allocation to one of the three groups on a 1:1:1 basis was done within 7 weeks of day 1 of the last chemotherapy cycle or within 6 weeks from the end of radiotherapy or deﬁnitive surgery—whichever was last.

A minimisation procedure, which followed the methods of Pocock and Simon,7 was used with stratiﬁcation by age, worldwide region, nodal status, type of chemotherapy, and hormone-receptor status, together with intention to use endocrine therapy. Randomisation was done at the site under the responsibility of the investigator with an interactive voice response system. The HERA trial is open label. 

Follow-up procedures All patients adhered to the same schedule of follow-up visits, which required recording of symptoms, side-eﬀects (graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0), and ﬁndings during clinical assessment every 3 months for the ﬁrst 2 years after randomisation, with haematological and chemistry studies done every 6 months. These assessments were scheduled to occur every 6 months for years 3–5, and then annually up to year 10. Annual chest radiography was needed up to year 5, and annual mammography up to year 10. 

Cardiac monitoring and study endpoints Cardiac monitoring in all groups included clinical assessments and measurements of LVEF by either echocardiography or multigated acquisition scanning at baseline; at months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36; and annually thereafter up to 10 years after randomisation. A primary cardiac endpoint was deﬁned as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV, conﬁrmed by a cardiologist, and a signiﬁcant LVEF drop of at least 10 percentage points from baseline and to an absolute LVEF below 50%, or cardiac death. A secondary cardiac endpoint was deﬁned as asymptomatic (NYHA class I) or mildly symptomatic (NYHA class II), with a signiﬁcant LVEF drop of at least 10 percentage points below baseline and to an absolute LVEF below 50%, conﬁrmed by repeat assessment. An algorithm was deﬁned in the protocol, which prescribed delay or cessation of trastuzumab in response to cardiac endpoints.8 The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, as previously deﬁned.1 For the comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab, disease-free survival was measured from the 12-month landmark. Separate protocol-speciﬁed analyses were prospectively planned to be done according to local assessment of the hormone-receptor status of the primary tumour. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, sites of ﬁrst relapse, and adverse events (particularly cardiac safety). Safety populations were deﬁned according to randomised assignment, except that 20 patients assigned to 1 year of trastuzumab and 27 patients assigned to 2 years who never actually received the drug were included in the observation group. Adverse events were recorded from the time of randomisation; those that occurred after patients in the observation group crossed over to the trastuzumab group were excluded. www.thelancet.com Vol 382 September 21, 2013

Statistical analysis The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab was designed to detect superiority in disease-free survival that was suﬃcient to yield an HR of 0·80 with 80% power. Two interim analyses were undertaken, and the ﬁnal analysis was planned when 725 disease-free survival events had been recorded in this comparison. A log-rank test p value of 0·045 or less was required for statistical signiﬁcance in this ﬁnal analysis. This report presents results based on 734 events of disease-free survival at a median follow-up of 8 years (7 years after treatments diverged; range 1–10 years). The eﬃcacy analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. χ² tests for categorical data and log-rank tests for time-to-event endpoints provided two-sided p values. Kaplan-Meier curves are presented. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate unadjusted HRs and 95% CIs. SAS software versions 8.2, 9.2, and 9.3 were used for statistical analyses. 

Role of the funding source The study was done under the auspices of the Breast International Group (BIG) and involved the collaboration of 17 BIG groups, nine other cooperative groups, 91 independent centres, and the pharmaceutical sponsor, all of which were represented in the Steering Committee of the HERA trial. Members of the Steering Committee designed the study. The database was maintained at the Breast European Adjuvant Study Team data centre in Brussels, Belgium. The datasets extracted from the database for analysis resided in a system of the sponsor, and access was restricted to statisticians of Frontier Science (Scotland) acting on behalf of BIG. The pharmaceutical sponsor had no access to the full database. Interim analyses were presented by the independent statisticians to the Independent Data Monitoring Committee without disclosure to the data centre, the investigators, or the sponsor. The HERA Steering Committee was responsible for the content of the report and for the decision to submit for publication. The sponsor provided the drug, some site monitoring, and ﬁnancial support. 

Results Figure 1 shows the trial proﬁle. Three patients with no record of written informed consent were excluded from analyses. The cohorts for comparison in the landmark analysis were well balanced in terms of demographics and baseline disease characteristics, including tumour size, node status, and hormone-receptor status (table 1). Overall, local laboratory analysis of hormone receptors showed that about half of the patients had hormonereceptor-positive disease (table 1). 1471 (92·6%) of the 1588 patients with hormone-receptor-positive disease received adjuvant endocrine therapy. 43 (2·8%) of the 1517 patients with hormone-receptor-negative disease received adjuvant endocrine therapy. 2772 (89·3%) patients received chemotherapy only postoperatively: www.thelancet.com Vol 382 September 21, 2013 

1386 of 1552 (89·3%) in the 1 year group and 1386 of 1553 (89·2%) in the 2 year group. 333 (10·7%) patients had received preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy: 166 (10·7%) of those in the 1 year group and 167 (10·8%) of those in the 2 year group. Previous chemotherapy, either adjuvant or neoadjuvant, included an anthracycline for 2920 (94·0%) of patients and a taxane for 792 (25·5%; table 1). Patients with node-negative disease were eligible for enrolment if the pathological tumour size was larger than 1 cm; 1019 (32·8%) of the patients included in the landmark analysis had node-negative disease. Overall, more than half of patients were 49 years of age or younger at study entry (table 1). Treatment compliance with randomised assignment of trastuzumab duration was generally good. Of

The clinical cutoﬀ date for this analysis was April 12, 2012, at which time we had recorded 367 disease-free survival events in the 2 year trastuzumab group and 367 in the 1 year group since the 12-month landmark. A comparison of disease-free survival showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between groups (HR 0·99, 95% CI 0·85–1·14, p=0·86 from the log-rank test; ﬁgure 2A). In predeﬁned exploratory analyses by hormone-receptor status, 2 years of trastuzumab did not improve disease-free survival for either subgroup (ﬁgure 2B and 2C). Annualised hazard 

patients included in the landmark analysis, 148 (9·5%) of 1552 patients randomly allocated to 1 year of trastuzumab either never started (three patients [0·2%]) or did not complete (145 [9·3%]) the year of treatment. Of 1553 patients randomised to 2 years of trastuzumab, 277 (17·8%) did not complete 2 years of treatment for reasons other than a disease-free survival event: seven (0·5%) never started, 157 (10·1%) discontinued before or at 1 year, and a further 113 (7·3%) discontinued before completing 2 years of treatment.

rate analysis showed that the short-term separation in disease-free survival curves for the hormone-receptornegative cohort seemed to be due to an excess of events during the ﬁrst year after treatment cessation in the 1 year trastuzumab group, but the diﬀerence was not signiﬁcant (appendix p 2). The annualised hazard rates for the 2 year trastuzumab group in the hormone-receptor-negative cohort showed a pattern similar to that noted for both treatment groups in the hormone-receptor-positive cohort (appendix pp 3–4). Overall survival did not diﬀer between trastuzumab groups (HR 1·05, 95% CI 0·86–1·28, p=0·63; appendix p 5). Table 2 shows the types of ﬁrst event of disease-free survival. Contributions to disease-free survival were assessed separately for breast cancer-related events and competing risks with use of standard cumulative incidence methods9 (ﬁgure 2D–F). Generally, results were similar between the 2 year and 1 year groups, with the exception that breast cancer-related events seemed to be more common in patients with hormone-receptornegative disease who were assigned to receive only 1 year of trastuzumab (ﬁgure 2F), although the diﬀerence was not signiﬁcant. By contrast, we noted no such diﬀerence in patients with hormone-receptor-positive disease, almost all of whom were receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy (ﬁgure 2E). More patients had at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event in the 2 year trastuzumab group than in the 1 year group (table 3). The body systems with the highest frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were: neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspeciﬁed (31 [1·8%] in observation group, 60 [3·6%] in 1 year group, and 77 [4·6%] in 2 year group); infections and infestations (12 [0·7%], 37 [2·2%], and 55 [3·3%], respectively); nervous system disorders (12 [0·7%], 14 [0·8%], and 33 [2·0%], respectively); vascular disorders (17 [1·0%], 31 [1·8%], and 33 [2·0%], respectively); cardiac disorders (eight [0·5%], 32 [1·9%], and 32 [1·9%], respectively); musculoskeletal disorders (22 [1·3%], 25 [1·5%], and 28 [1·7%], respectively); general disorders and administration site conditions (eight [0·5%], 17 [1·0%], and 27 [1·6%], respectively); gastrointestinal disorders (six [0·3%], 17 [1·0%], and 28 [1·7%], respectively); injury, poisoning, and procedural complications (12 [0·7%], 18 [1·1%], and 23 [1·4%], respectively). All other body systems had fewer than 20 (<1·2%) patients with grade 3 or 4 adverse events in any group. Primary (severely symptomatic) cardiac endpoints were rare and their occurrence did not diﬀer between the two treatment groups (ﬁgure 3A). Secondary (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) cardiac endpoints occurred more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (table 3), largely because the constant event rate recorded in both groups during the ﬁrst year was continued for a second year in the 2 year treatment group (ﬁgure 3B). In both groups, cardiac events were rare after completion of trastuzumab treatment. www.thelancet.com Vol 382 September 21, 2013 

Separate from the primary landmark analysis, we undertook a descriptive intention-to-treat analysis of the outcome of all three groups from the date of original randomisation (appendix pp 6–9). Importantly, this analysis allows updated comparison of the 1 year treatment group versus the observation-only group, and extends analyses already reported at median follow-up of 1, 2, and 4 years.1,4,5 The selective crossover of patients randomly allocated to observation after publication of the initial trial results led to 884 (52·1%) of the 1697 patients in the observation group receiving trastuzumab before a disease-free survival event. This occurrence was associated with progressively smaller apparent beneﬁts of 1 year of trastuzumab in previously reported intention-totreat analyses.5 The eﬀect of such crossover seems to have abated, in that our results of an intention-to-treat comparison between 1 year trastuzumab and the observation group indicated no further attenuation of beneﬁt and showed a robust and persistent improvement in diseasefree survival and overall survival, despite the eﬀect of selective crossover (ﬁgure 4). In particular, the HR for disease-free survival at median follow-up of 8 years was 1 year of trastuzumab (n=1552)

Figure 4: Hazard ratios and conﬁdence intervals in a comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation (intention-to-treat analysis) (A) Disease-free survival. (B) Overall survival. Results for 1, 2, and 4 years’ median follow-up are found in references 1, 3, and 4, respectively. These intention-to-treat analyses are aﬀected by selective crossover of 884 (52%) of patients in the observation group who received trastuzumab after the ﬁrst results were released in 2005. The numbers in parentheses show the percentage of follow-up time in the intention-to-treat analysis that was accrued after selective crossover for patients assigned to the observation group. DFS=disease-free survival. HR=hazard ratio. OS=overall survival. 

0·76 (95% CI 0·67–0·86, p<0·0001), and the overall survival HR, which was 0·85 (0·70–1·04) at median follow-up of 4 years, is now 0·76 (0·65–0·88) at 8 years’ median follow-up. 

Discussion Patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer given adjuvant trastuzumab have shown substantial improvements in disease-free and overall survival outcomes compared with those given no trastuzumab.10 Trastuzumab is the most eﬀective targeted drug in breast cancer since tamoxifen. Findings from the HERA trial have supported the beneﬁcial eﬀects of trastuzumab, 1026 

and this report extends the evidence of a substantial improvement in disease-free and overall survival to a median of 8 years’ follow-up. The HERA trial also tested the hypothesis that continuation of trastuzumab treatment beyond 1 year would be superior to 1 year of such treatment. Our results show no such additional beneﬁt, and a small but real increase in adverse events, leading to an unfavourable beneﬁt–risk ratio for 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab (panel). This ﬁnding, together with the high cost of trastuzumab, supports a standard duration of 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab. This result will be important to many women with early breast cancer and to the health-care systems that treat them. The ﬁnding is also important to the validity of the 1 year trastuzumab control groups included in ongoing phase 3 trials in which adjuvant treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer are being investigated. Predeﬁned subgroup analyses by hormone-receptor status, although not deﬁnitive, are intriguing. Within the cohort of patients with hormone-receptor-positive disease, the second year of treatment can be thought of as a comparison between endocrine treatment plus trastuzumab and endocrine therapy alone. By contrast, during the second year of treatment, the hormonereceptor-negative cohort received either trastuzumab alone or no further adjuvant treatment (table 1). The temporary and not statistically signiﬁcant separation of the curves in favour of 2 years of trastuzumab in the hormone-receptor-negative cohort is indicative of a short-term increased risk of relapse, especially during the second year when these patients receive no adjuvant therapy at all. By contrast, the pattern of relapse in the hormone-receptor-negative cohort receiving a second year of trastuzumab closely resembles that recorded for patients in both groups within the hormone-receptorpositive cohort. The mechanism of such an eﬀect after cessation of all adjuvant therapy at 1 year, if indeed such an eﬀect is biologically real, is unknown. Although these ﬁndings are intriguing, they do not provide evidence to support the extension of adjuvant trastuzumab treatment in patients with hormone-receptor-negative disease. www.thelancet.com Vol 382 September 21, 2013

In other trials, investigators have studied the possible beneﬁt of trastuzumab therapy for less than 1 year. The FinHER investigators11 showed a beneﬁt in terms of disease-free survival from 9 weeks of trastuzumab treatment compared with no trastuzumab, which was similar to the magnitude of beneﬁt noted in the trials of 1 year of trastuzumab, although this conclusion of course involves cross-study comparison. These investigators are doing a randomised trial (the Synergism or Long Duration [SOLD] study) to compare their previous 9 week trastuzumab regimen with 1 year of trastuzumab therapy (NCT00593697). In the SHORT-HER trial (NCT00629278) in Italy, investigators are also assessing 9 weeks versus 12 months of trastuzumab treatment. A direct randomised comparison of 6 versus 12 months of trastuzumab was undertaken by the PHARE investigators in France, and the ﬁrst results for 3380 patients at 42·5 months of median follow-up have been reported.12 The PHARE trial did not show that 6 months of trastuzumab is non-inferior to 12 months (HR 1·28, 95% CI 1·05–1·56, p=0·29 for a non-inferiority HR of 1·15).12 The PERSEPHONE trial,13 being undertaken in the UK, and a trial by the Hellenic Oncology Research Group (NCT00615602) are also comparing 6 versus 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab. Updated results from the PHARE trial and completion of the ongoing trials will be important to ascertain whether patients can be oﬀered a shorter duration of trastuzumab therapy without a compromise on eﬃcacy. Trastuzumab treatment is associated with an increased risk of cardiac toxicity.14–16 Patients in the HERA study started trastuzumab at a median of 8·4 months after initial diagnosis of breast cancer and a median of 89 days after completing all chemotherapy, and had to have an LVEF of at least 55% after chemotherapy. In this group, that the incidence of cardiac toxicity was low, particularly in comparison with the recently reported populationbased cohort study,15 is thus not surprising. Almost all cardiac events were recorded during trastuzumab administration, with very few additional events after trastuzumab completion. As reported previously, most of these events were reversible.14 The estimate of the advantage in disease-free and overall survival derived from the intention-to-treat analysis comparing 1 year trastuzumab with observation from randomisation is probably conservative since 52% of patients in the observation group chose to receive trastuzumab after the initial trial results, and almost 50% of the follow-up time in the intention-to-treat observation population accrued after this crossover. However, the attenuating eﬀect of this crossover was mostly seen in the early years of follow-up. There has been no potential for additional crossover since the 4 year median follow-up analysis,5 and the estimate of the overall survival advantage has indeed improved.

Panel: Research in context Systematic review When the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial was started in 2001, trastuzumab had been shown to be eﬀective for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. HERA was one of several trials done at that time to assess the role of trastuzumab compared with no trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting. The large phase 3 trials (namely HERA, NCCTG N9831, NSABP B-31, and BCIRG 006) assessed trastuzumab administered for the arbitrary duration of 1 year. HERA was unique among these trials because of its inclusion of a third randomised group given trastuzumab for 2 years. Interpretation With a median of 8 years’ follow-up, the HERA trial has shown that 2 years of trastuzumab treatment has an unfavourable beneﬁt–risk ratio compared with 1 year of treatment. Other trials of durations shorter than 1 year have yet to show equivalence to 1 year of treatment. Thus, 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab remains the de-facto standard of care for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer—a treatment approach that is supported by our ﬁndings in this report. 

trastuzumab,1–3 a de-facto standard of care of 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab has been established in practice. Our results showed an unfavourable beneﬁt–risk ratio for 2 years of trastuzumab therapy, and thus support the continuation of the 1 year standard duration of treatment.
