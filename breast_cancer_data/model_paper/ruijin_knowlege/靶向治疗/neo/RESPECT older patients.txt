METHODS This study was an open-label, randomized controlled study with a treatment selection design in which a noninferiority criterion was predeﬁned. Patients aged 70-80 years with surgically treated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive invasive breast cancer received trastuzumab monotherapy or trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) with assessment of prespeciﬁed hazard ratio (HR), relapse-free survival (RFS), adverse events (AEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and restricted mean survival time (RMST). RESULTS The study involved 275 patients (mean age, 73.5 years) who were followed up for a mean of 4.1 years (range, 0.3-8.0 years). The percentages of patients by cancer stage were as follows: I (pT . 0.5 cm), 43.6%; IIA, 41.7%; IIB, 13.5%; and IIIA, 1.1%. Three-year DFS was 89.5% with trastuzumab monotherapy versus 93.8% with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.72 to 2.58; P 5 .51). At 3 years, RMST differed by 20.39 months between arms (95% CI, 21.71 to 0.93; P 5 .56). Three-year RFS was 92.4% with trastuzumab monotherapy versus 95.3% with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.63 to 2.79; P 5 .53). Common AEs were anorexia (7.4% v 44.3%; P , .0001) and alopecia (2.2% v 71.7%; P , .0001), and grade 3/4 nonhematologic AEs occurred in 11.9% versus 29.8% (P 5 .0003) for trastuzumab monotherapy versus trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy, respectively. Clinically meaningful HRQoL deterioration rate showed signiﬁcant differences at 2 months (31% for trastuzumab monotherapy v 48% for trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy; P 5 .016) and at 1 year (19% v 38%; P 5 .009). CONCLUSION The primary objective of noninferiority for trastuzumab monotherapy was not met. However, the observed loss of survival without chemotherapy was , 1 month at 3 years. Therefore, and in light of the lower toxicity and more favorable HRQoL proﬁle, trastuzumab monotherapy can be considered an adjuvant therapy option for selected older patients.

INTRODUCTION Trastuzumab with chemotherapy is a standard adjuvant systemic therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive primary breast cancer.1-4 Overexpression of HER2 is also associated with potentially more aggressive tumors5,6; consequently, trastuzumab is a key drug for the treatment of HER2-positive primary cancer. Trastuzumab monotherapy used as an adjuvant treatment without chemotherapy avoids toxicity, especially in older patients who are at increased risk of severe chemotherapy- 

induced toxicity,7-9 but it is not used in clinical practice, because its beneﬁt has not been investigated.10 Because even the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group overview does not arrive at a clear conclusion on the usability of chemotherapy in patients . 70 years of age, due to limited data,11 no standard treatment exists for these patients. Women in Japan have the highest life expectancy in the world, at 86.8 years.12 Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women; 95,257 women were diagnosed in 2016, of whom 26.3% were older than

CONTEXT Key Objective To compare trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy in older patients, we carried out a randomized, prospective adjuvant trial comparing trastuzumab monotherapy with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive breast cancer, speciﬁcally in patients older than 70 years. Knowledge Generated The primary objective of noninferiority for trastuzumab monotherapy was not met. However, restricted mean survival time revealed that the observed loss of survival without chemotherapy was , 1 month at 3 years, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was better with lower rates of common adverse events. Relevance Trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy remains a standard of care. In patients . 70 years of age who need to avoid chemotherapy because of contraindications or patient preference, especially patients aged . 75 years with performance status 1 disease and estrogen-receptor positivity, we found relatively small inﬂuences on chemotherapy effects. With lower toxicity and better HRQoL proﬁle, trastuzumab monotherapy can be a reasonable option for selected older patients with favorable outcomes. 

70 years. In the SEER program of the National Cancer Institute, 268,600 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019, of whom 44.1% were . 65 years old. Older adults suffer the majority of cancer diagnoses and deaths, and also make up the majority of cancer survivors; however, the evidence base for treating this population is sparse. ASCO has proposed developing recommendations to improve the evidence base for treating older adults with cancer in response to a critical need.13 To address this, we designed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the beneﬁt of trastuzumab monotherapy compared with trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy on the efﬁcacy, incidence of adverse events (AEs), and quality of life in terms of the noninferiority criterion. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients The trial protocol is provided in the Data Supplement. We recruited patients aged 70-80 years with HER2-positive breast cancer who had undergone surgery with curative intent. Inclusion criteria comprised the following: invasive breast cancer histologically diagnosed as HER2 positive according to the ASCO and College of American Pathologists guidelines14; stage I (pathologic tumor size . 0.5 cm), IIA, IIB, or IIIA cancer; and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) $ 55%. Other eligibility criteria and exclusion criteria are listed in the Data Supplement. This study was reviewed and approved by the appropriate independent ethics committees and institutional review boards. This study conformed with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Ethical Guidelines for Clinical Research of Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The protocol 

was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network, Japan (protocol ID: UMIN000002349), on September 1, 2009, and with ClinicalTrials.gov (identiﬁer: NCT01104935) on November 6, 2009. Trial Design and Oversight This was an open-label, randomized, parallel group, comparative study with a treatment selection design in which a determining criterion was deﬁned in advance and used to demonstrate clinical beneﬁt between two groups in terms of efﬁcacy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either trastuzumab monotherapy or trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy. Randomization was performed at the data center after conﬁrming patient eligibility with assignment adjustment factors, as follows: age (70-75 v 76-80 years), performance status (0 v 1), hormone receptor status (positive [$ 10%] v negative), pathologic nodal status (positive v negative), and participating institution. We hypothesized that (1) trastuzumab monotherapy is not markedly inferior to trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), and (2) trastuzumab monotherapy is superior in terms of safety and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy treatment comprised a loading dose of trastuzumab at 8 mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 1 year. Chemotherapy was selected from the following regimens prespeciﬁed in the protocol, based on a joint decision by physician and patient: 1. Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 for 12 weeks. 2. Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 for 4 cycles. 3. Doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 for 4 cycles.

4. Epirubicin 90 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 for 4 cycles. 5. Cyclophosphamide 75-100 mg orally, methotrexate 40 mg/m2, and 5-ﬂuorouracil 500-600 mg/m2 (CMF) intravenously for 6 cycles. 6. Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (TC) for 4 cycles. 7. Docetaxel 60-75 mg/m2, carboplatin area under the curve 5-6 mg/ml/min trastuzumab loading dose 4 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg (TCbH) for 6 cycles. Patients treated with trastuzumab monotherapy received the same dose of trastuzumab. Details, including dose modiﬁcations, are provided in the protocol (Data Supplement). End Points The primary end point was DFS, comparing treatment arms by hazard ratio (HR), and calculating restricted mean survival time (RMST) for each arm as a supplementary analysis. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), adverse events (AEs), HRQoL, and comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Assessment The protocol required assessment of LVEF at registration, every 3 months during trastuzumab administration, and every 6 months after completion of trastuzumab treatment. The HRQoL of the study population was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-general (FACT-G) scale at baseline, 2 months, 1 year, and 3 years. FACT-G is a validated, brief yet sensitive, 28-item general cancer HRQoL measure.15 The analysis of HRQoL was FACT-G total score, and a $ 5-point change from baseline score was considered meaningful.16 After completion of the protocol treatment, clinical examinations were required at each hospital visit. Statistical Analysis The primary end point required 120 events in total, given a power of 80% and a threshold HR of 1.69. Given that the probability of 3 years’ DFS in the study population was 68%-72%, and assuming that the survival time follows an exponential distribution, a total of 260 patients registered over 4 years and followed-up for 3 years was necessary to assess 120 events. To evaluate the clinical position of each treatment, the estimated HR was compared with a threshold HR of 1.69. This threshold for “addition of chemotherapy is determined to be a deﬁnite advantage” was based on the results of a questionnaire in advance answered by physicians of this medical ﬁeld (Data Supplement). The threshold was used to determine whether trastuzumab treatment was deﬁnitely equivalent (not inferior) to trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy with regard to DFS. An upper limit of the 95% CI of the HR for trastuzumab monotherapy relative to trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy, calculated by applying the proportional 

hazards model, not exceeding 1.69, would demonstrate the marked noninferiority of trastuzumab monotherapy, making this a possible treatment option. In this study, RMST was calculated as a supplementary analysis because blinded annual monitoring on September 1, 2015, showed that the number of events was far fewer than expected, and the statistical power of the noninferiority test based on HR was not assured. The conventional procedure for evaluating long-term treatment effects on survival is the log-rank test and HR. However, if the number of events is too small in a noninferior study to give sufﬁcient information regarding the two treatment arms, RMST can be an option to qualify survival beneﬁt in a comparative oncology clinical study.17-19 All collected data were analyzed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Details of the end points, assessment, and the statistical analysis are provided in the Data Supplement. RESULTS Patients The CONSORT diagram is shown in Figure 1. From October 2009 through November 2014, a total of 275 patients aged 70-80 years with HER2-positive invasive breast cancer were enrolled from 99 institutions. Nine patients (3.3%) were excluded, leaving 266 for full-set analysis (trastuzumab monotherapy [n 5 135] and trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy [n 5 131]). Characteristics of the patients at baseline are listed in Table 1. The median age of patients was 73.5 years (range, 70-80 years) and the median followup time was 4.1 years (range, 0.3-8.0 years). Most patients (43.6%) had stage I disease, 41.7% had stage IIA, 13.5% had IIB, and 1.1% had IIIA. Chemotherapy regimens were paclitaxel (35.1%), anthracycline (22.9%), CMF (19.8%), docetaxel (14.5%), or TC (3.1%). The relative dose intensity (RDI) values are shown in Appendix Table A1 (online only). The RDI of trastuzumab was 84.4% with trastuzumab monotherapy and 81.8% with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy. Concurrent infusion of trastuzumab was allowed when combined with paclitaxel, docetaxel, or CMF, as received by 93.5%, 94.7%, and 46.2% of patients, respectively. Selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators were administered to 14.2% of patients and aromatase inhibitors were administered to 69.3%. Partial mastectomy was performed in 80 patients (30.0%), of whom 9 received irradiation of the breast. DFS, RFS, and OS The data cutoff date was October 31, 2017. The planned analysis showed that 3-year DFS was 89.5% (95% CI, 82.9 to 93.6) with trastuzumab monotherapy versus 93.8% (95% CI, 87.9 to 96.8) with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.72 to 2.58; P 5 .51; Fig 2). The cumulative total number of events in DFS was 18 with trastuzumab monotherapy and 15 with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy. Details are listed in Appendix Table A2.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant treatment either with trastuzumab monotherapy or with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy ( investigator’s selection from regimens speciﬁed on the protocol: paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2; epirubicin 90 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2; ﬂuorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide 75-100 mg orally, methotrexate 40 mg/m2, and 5-ﬂuorouracil 500-600 mg/m2; docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2; or docetaxel 60-75 mg/m2, carboplatin area under the curve 5-6 mg/ml/min, trastuzumab loading dose 4 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg for 6 cycles). 

Distant metastasis occurred in nine patients who received trastuzumab monotherapy and eight patients who received trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy. The posterior probability that the HR was , 1.69 was estimated at 74.5%. The difference in RMST for DFS between the study arms at 3 years was 20.39 months (95% CI, 21.71 to 0.93; P 5 .56). The 3-year RFS was 92.4% (95% CI, 86.3 to 95.8; n 5 17 events with seven deaths) with trastuzumab monotherapy versus 95.3% (95% CI, 89.7 to 97.8; n 5 12 events with six deaths) with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.63 to 2.79; Fig 3). The difference in RMST for RFS between arms at 3 years was 20.41 months (95% CI, 21.51 to 0.68; P 5 .53). Three-year OS was 97.2% (95% CI, 91.2 to 99.1) with trastuzumab monotherapy versus 96.6% (95% CI, 89.5 to 98.9) with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.36 to 3.19; Fig 4). Distant DFS at 3 years was 93.1% with trastuzumab monotherapy versus 96.8% with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.64 to 3.17; P 5 .39; Appendix Fig A1, online only). Breast cancer–speciﬁc survival at 3 years was 99.2% with trastuzumab monotherapy versus 99.2% with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy (HR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.02 to 1.67; P 5 .14; Appendix Fig A2). 

Subgroup analysis of DFS is shown in Table 2. On the basis of the Cox model prespeciﬁed subgroup analyses for background or prognostic factors conducted to estimate HR with 95% CI, age . 75 years, performance status 1 (PS1), and ER positivity had relatively small effects on the outcome of chemotherapy, which were not signiﬁcant. Safety All patients who underwent the protocol treatment were included in the safety analysis. Common AEs are listed in Table 3. Common AEs were neutropenia (9.6% with trastuzumab monotherapy v 42.0% with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy; P , .0001), anorexia (7.4% v 44.3%; P , .0001), and alopecia (2.2% v 71.7%; P , .0001). No grade 4 hematologic AEs occurred with trastuzumab monotherapy but were reported with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy (0% v 13.7%; P , .0001). Similarly, some grade 3 or 4 nonhematological AEs occurred with trastuzumab monotherapy but the rate more than doubled with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy (11.9% v 29.8%; P 5 .0003). In patients who received the most-used regimen, paclitaxel 1 trastuzumab, neuropathy-sensory AEs of any grade occurred in 65.2% of patients. No patients discontinued trastuzumab treatment because of toxicity. All serious AEs resolved.

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst randomized prospective adjuvant trial to compare trastuzumab monotherapy with trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy for HER2-positive breast cancer. The primary end point was not met on HR, although prespeciﬁed analysis was performed supplementary to investigation of RMST. To our knowledge, it is also the ﬁrst study to speciﬁcally enroll patients older than 70 years. DFS at 3 years was 93.8% in the trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy group but 89.5% with less toxicity and a better HRQoL proﬁle in the trastuzumab monotherapy group.

LVEF decreases occurred in 11 patients (8.1%) in the trastuzumab monotherapy group and in nine patients (6.8%) in the trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy group (P 5 .647). 

Trastuzumab without chemotherapy has not been assessed in the adjuvant setting, as far as we are aware. In the metastatic setting, trastuzumab monotherapy has efﬁcacy with low toxicity,20,21 although combination chemotherapy with trastuzumab is generally preferred.22 In the neoadjuvant setting, trastuzumab 1 pertuzumab without chemotherapy was tested, but chemotherapy was administered after surgery.23 With regard to trastuzumab AEs, cardiac dysfunction and CHF have been reported.24-26 A long-term assessment found that the incidence of decreased LVEF was 3.6%, whereas that of severe CHF was 0.8%.27 The cardiac event rate was highest in patients who received anthracycline (1.9%-3.8%)28 and lowest in patients who received a TCbH regimen (0.4%).4 Independent predictors of cardiac events were age . 50 years and a low LVEF.29 Among older patients, a systematic review indicated that cardiac events occurred in 5% of patients.30 A large observational study indicated that the risk of cardiac function toxicity was 5.7%31 and that this risk was associated with age,31,32 although it remained manageable31 and the risks associated with trastuzumab were outweighed by the beneﬁts.30,31 In our

trial, cardiac events occurred in 7.5% of patients, but because this was a prospective study, LVEF was routinely evaluated and, as a result, decreases in LVEF were detected, and no CHF occurred. Our results thus provide safety data on trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy for older patients. In older patients, HRQoL is important in addition to the incidence of AEs, because chemotherapy causes signiﬁcant deterioration of HRQoL.33 The European Society for Medical Oncology proposed a Clinical Beneﬁt Scale incorporating toxicity and HRQoL as outcomes of living better with adjuvant therapy,34 although there is no deﬁnitive consensus on how to assess and interpret risks and beneﬁts. The ﬁndings of our study on short-term toxicity and the impact on HRQoL are useful for treatment selection in older patients. Older adults do not differ from their younger counterparts regarding chemotherapy acceptance, but 

they do differ in terms of willingness to trade survival for current QoL.35 Consequently, HRQoL deterioration, even if temporary, is important when deciding whether to receive chemotherapy. In our trial, the upper threshold of HR of 1.69, an inferior margin deﬁned in advance, was set based on a questionnaire among physicians, because older patients may not accept a small absolute beneﬁt if treatment carries a high risk of AEs, loss of independence, and cognitive impairment. For a more deﬁnitive answer to anti-HER2 therapy without chemotherapy, biomarkers will be important in selecting a suitable population to optimize beneﬁt. Meanwhile, we await the results from other studies of de-escalation. In the ATEMPT trial comparing paclitaxel 1 trastuzumab with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), the latter was associated with a low rate of recurrence, although it did not meet the preplanned relative reduction in toxicity.36 The ATOP trial

(ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT03587740) is a single-arm study of T-DM1 in patients . 60 years of age. Short duration of trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy was associated with worse outcome despite a favorable cardiotoxicity.37 In our subgroup analysis, we found age . 75 years, PS1, and ER positivity had relatively small inﬂuences on the effects of chemotherapy. There might be a difference in the impact of chemotherapy between pureHER2 and luminal-HER2 type,23 and ER positivity affected 

FIG 4. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS). OS at 3 years was 97.2% (95% CI, 91.2 to 99.1) in the trastuzumab monotherapy group versus 96.6% (95% CI, 89.53 to 98.9) in the trastuzumab 1 chemotherapy group (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.36 to 3.19). Tick marks indicate censored data. 

the timing of DFS events and patterns, providing prognostic information.38 Limitations of this study include, ﬁrst, that although 266 patients were treated according to the protocol, the primary end point was not met on HR, because of the low numbers of events consequent to an underpowered analysis. As a result, no deﬁnitive conclusions regarding trastuzumab without chemotherapy in this setting can be made. The prognosis of patients in both arms was better than expected

because . 80% of patients enrolled had stage I or stage IIA disease. In view of patients’ baseline risk, it is not always possible to apply results to all HER2-positive older patients. It was assumed that enlarging the sample size to increase the number of events would have rendered the study unfeasible because of the relatively smaller proportion of HER2-positive older patients and their heterogeneity.39 We could have extended the follow-up period to detect more events, but it was assumed that non–breast cancer deaths, as well as recurrences, would accumulate in both arms over the 8 years that had passed since the ﬁrst patient was enrolled. However, a longer follow-up period is needed to shed light on patient prognosis. Second, patients aged 70-80 years still had only a modest number of comorbidities, with LVEF $ 55%; in other words, they were healthy patients with good performance. In fact, the majority of these patients received . 80% of the RDI. These healthy patients were able to tolerate standard chemotherapy with trastuzumab, which results in the best prognosis, as supported by the results of the APT trial.40 Chronological age by itself is not a stand-alone biomarker; thus, ﬁt older patients who are 

deemed suitable may be offered standard treatment. To distinguish between ﬁt or vulnerable older persons, CGA may be useful.41 In this study, we selected as many patients as possible who could be treated at least with trastuzumab as monotherapy, with optional chemotherapy regimens at the physician’s discretion. We did not exclude less-ﬁt older patients but included both ﬁt and vulnerable patients. After analyzing CGA data, we hope to create predictive tools for AEs or prognosis. In the ﬁeld of geriatric oncology, the inclusion of functional end points is needed, which can aid in shared decision-making by physicians and patients.42 In older patients considered ﬁt for chemotherapy, standard treatment can be offered, but such decisions could be individualized by weighing competing risks. In conclusion, the primary objective of noninferiority for trastuzumab monotherapy was not met. However, the observed loss of survival without chemotherapy was , 1 month at 3 years. Therefore, and in light of the lower toxicity and more favorable HRQoL proﬁle, trastuzumab monotherapy can be considered an adjuvant therapy option for selected older patients.
