Eﬃcacy and safety of neoadjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab in women with locally advanced, inﬂammatory, or early HER2-positive breast cancer (NeoSphere): a randomised multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial Luca Gianni, Tadeusz Pienkowski, Young-Hyuck Im, Laslo Roman, Ling-Ming Tseng, Mei-Ching Liu, Ana Lluch, Elżbieta Staroslawska, Juan de la Haba-Rodriguez, Seock-Ah Im, Jose Luiz Pedrini, Brigitte Poirier, Paolo Morandi, Vladimir Semiglazov, Vichien Srimuninnimit, Giulia Bianchi, Tania Szado, Jayantha Ratnayake, Graham Ross, Pinuccia Valagussa 

Summary Background Studies with pertuzumab, a novel anti-HER2 antibody, show improved eﬃcacy when combined with the established HER2-directed antibody trastuzumab in breast cancer therapy. We investigated the combination of pertuzumab or trastuzumab, or both, with docetaxel and the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab without chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting.

Methods In this multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study, treatment-naive women with HER2-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) centrally and stratiﬁed by operable, locally advanced, and inﬂammatory breast cancer, and by hormone receptor expression to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of: trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m², escalating, if tolerated, to 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks; group A) or pertuzumab (loading dose 840 mg, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks) and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) or pertuzumab and trastuzumab (group C) or pertuzumab plus docetaxel (group D). The primary endpoint, examined in the intention-to-treat population, was pathological complete response in the breast. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00545688.

Findings Of 417 eligible patients, 107 were randomly assigned to group A, 107 to group B, 107 to group C, and 96 to group D. Patients given pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) had a signiﬁcantly improved pathological complete response rate (49 of 107 patients; 45·8% [95% CI 36·1–55·7]) compared with those given trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group A; 31 of 107; 29·0% [20·6–38·5]; p=0·0141). 23 of 96 (24·0% [15·8–33·7]) women given pertuzumab plus docetaxel (group D) had a pathological complete response, as did 18 of 107 (16·8% [10·3–25·3]) given pertuzumab and trastuzumab (group C). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (61 of 107 women in group A, 48 of 107 in group B, one of 108 in group C, and 52 of 94 in group D), febrile neutropenia (eight, nine, none, and seven, respectively), and leucopenia (13, ﬁve, none, and seven, respectively). The number of serious adverse events was similar in groups A, B, and D (15–20 serious adverse events per group in 10–17% of patients) but lower in group C (four serious adverse events in 4% of patients). Interpretation Patients given pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B) had a signiﬁcantly improved pathological complete response rate compared with those given trastuzumab plus docetaxel, without substantial diﬀerences in tolerability. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab without chemotherapy eradicated tumours in a proportion of women and showed a favourable safety proﬁle. These ﬁndings justify further exploration in adjuvant trials and support the neoadjuvant approach for accelerating drug assessment in early breast cancer. Funding F Hoﬀmann-La Roche. 

Introduction 20–25% of breast cancers overexpress HER2 and are associated with poor prognosis if untreated.1 Trastuzumab, a HER2-directed humanised monoclonal antibody, combined with chemotherapy, signiﬁcantly improves response rates, time to progression, and overall survival in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer compared with chemotherapy alone.2 Furthermore, in women with operable disease, trastuzumab improves disease-free survival and overall survival when given for 1 year in combination with or sequentially after www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 13 January 2012 

chemotherapy, as recommended for adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab.3,4 Positive eﬃcacy outcomes with trastuzumab prompted the search to identify other HER2-targeted drugs capable of improving the therapeutic eﬀects of trastuzumab in combination or in sequential administration.5 Pertuzumab is an investigational humanised monoclonal antibody directed at the dimerisation domain of HER2.6 Because of their diﬀerent bindings sites, trastuzumab and pertuzumab have complementary mechanisms of action. Whereas trastuzumab blocks HER2 cleavage and inhibits ligand-independent signalling,7 pertuzumab exerts its

eﬀects by inhibiting ligand-dependent signalling, particularly between HER2 and HER3, which is known to activate a potent cell survival and proliferation signal.8,9 Both antibodies induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic eﬀects.10 In a phase 2 trial11 in patients with HER2positive metastatic breast cancer, almost a quarter of patients treated with pertuzumab and trastuzumab after tumour progression during previous trastuzumab-based therapy achieved an objective response. Administration of drug therapy to women with operable or locally advanced breast cancer before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) has emerged as a successful approach to allow for surgery in cases that are inoperable at diagnosis, or to allow use of breast-sparing approaches rather than mastectomy.12,13 A corollary aspect of neoadjuvant treatment is the ability to assess antitumour activity of new treatment regimens in terms of pathological ﬁndings instead of imaging results or late-emerging evidence such as survival. Based on comparative rates of pathological complete response, neoadjuvant trials are ideally suited to accelerate the assessment of new drugs. Pathological complete response consists of pathological evidence of eradication of invasive cancer after pre-surgery drug administration and serves as a surrogate for longterm eﬃcacy,12,14,15 providing a robust rationale to design adjuvant trials. Combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab has substantially improved rates of pathological complete response.14,16 Here, we present the results of the NeoSphere study in which the activity of pertuzumab was assessed by 

comparing the therapeutic eﬀects of the conventional combination of trastuzumab plus docetaxel with the combination of pertuzumab with either docetaxel or trastuzumab, or both, in a neoadjuvant setting. 

Methods Study design and patients NeoSphere is a randomised, multicentre, international, open-label phase 2 study in women with locally advanced, inﬂammatory, or early HER2-positive breast cancer. AlleligiblepatientshadcentrallyconﬁrmedHER2-positive, operable (T2–3, N0–1, M0), locally advanced (T2–3, N2–3, M0 or T4a–c, any N, M0), or inﬂammatory (T4d, any N, M0) breast cancer with primary tumours larger than 2 cm in diameter, were aged 18 years or older, and had not received any previous cancer therapy. Tumours had to be HER2 immunohistochemistry 3+ or 2+ and positive for ﬂuorescence or chromogenic in-situ hybridisation. Other main inclusion criteria were: baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55% or more, as measured by echocardiography or multiple gated acquisition (MUGA). Key exclusion criteria were metastatic disease (stage IV), bilateral breast cancer, other malignancies, inadequate bone marrow or renal function, impaired liver function, impaired cardiac function, uncontrolled hypertension, pregnancy, and refusal to use contraception. The study was undertaken in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Randomisation and masking 

Median age (years, range) 

Patients were centrally randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive one of four neoadjuvant treatments: trastuzumab (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) plus docetaxel (Sanoﬁ-Aventis, Paris, France; group A); pertuzumab (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group B); pertuzumab and trastuzumab without chemotherapy (group C); or pertuzumab plus docetaxel (group D). After 29 patients had been recruited to the study, group D was added to assess the activity of pertuzumab plus docetaxel without trastuzumab. We used an interactive voice response system to obtain screening information for every patient. Patients were randomly assigned treatment by a central randomisation procedure with the adaptive randomisation method and stratiﬁed by operable, locally advanced, and inﬂammatory breast cancer, and by positivity for oestrogen or progesterone receptors. This trial was open label.

Trastuzumab was given every 3 weeks at 8 mg/kg (cycle 1), followed by 6 mg/kg. The pertuzumab loading dose was 840 mg, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks. Docetaxel was given at 75 mg/m², escalating, if tolerated, to 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks. After completion of neoadjuvant treatment (four intravenous cycles), eligible patients underwent surgery and adjuvant FEC therapy (three cycles of ﬂuorouracil 600 mg/m² intravenously, epirubicin 90 mg/m² intravenously, and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m² intravenously every 3 weeks) in all groups except for group C, in which patients received four cycles of docetaxel before FEC. All patients received concomitant trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 1 year. Radiotherapy and standard hormone treatment for patients positive for oestrogen receptor were prescribed as per local guidelines. Tumour response (clinical breast examination) was assessed at every cycle. Patients underwent physical examination, mammogram, and ultrasound (if required by local practice) before breast surgery. Surgical specimens were assessed locally for pathological complete response. Tumour samples for banking were obtained at study entry and at surgery for the assessment of biomarkers that might be predictive of response to pertuzumab and trastuzumab or prognostic for breast cancer. Results of biomarker analyses will be reported separately. According to protocol, attending doctors were free to decide when a patient was not deriving beneﬁt, to report progression, and to discontinue the allocated protocol treatment irrespective of the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) deﬁnition of progression. We measured LVEF by echocardiography (or MUGA) every second cycle and compiled the baseline LVEF value and the maximum absolute change from baseline. We

assessed laboratory parameters, blood counts, ECOG status, and vital signs at every cycle and monitored adverse events continuously until 28 days after the last treatment. We graded the intensity of these events according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3·0. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response in the breast, which is deﬁned as the absence of invasive neoplastic cells at microscopic examination of the primary tumour at surgery. Remaining in-situ lesions were allowed. Pathologists at participating centres followed guidelines for the assessment of pathological complete response on serial sections of the surgical specimen (appendix). Blinded pathology data were reviewed by a consultant pathologist at regular intervals to ensure consistency. Secondary objectives included clinical response rate (derived clinical response according to RECIST version 1·017), time to clinical response, breastconserving surgery rate, and safety.

pathological complete response rate of 25% in group A and group D and a rate of 40% in group B or group C. We present intention-to-treat analyses unless otherwise speciﬁed. We planned three comparisons (group A vs B, group A vs C, and group B vs D) using a two-sided Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test at an alpha level of 0·2 (SAS version 8.2). We used breast cancer status and hormone receptor status at baseline as stratiﬁcation factors. Formal comparison of group D with group A was not prespeciﬁed because group D was added to the study after a protocol amendment and, hence, was not powered to test hypotheses. This is a phase 2, proof-of-concept study and, therefore, the main focus was to make preliminary estimates of the level of activity associated with the experimental treatment groups. Therefore, the α level was set at a 20% level rather than a 5% level as conventionally used in conﬁrmatory trials. The data cutoﬀ for this primary study report of the neoadjuvant phase of the trial occurred at the last patient’s surgery or withdrawal in December, 2009. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00545688. 

Role of the funding source The study was conceived and designed by LG and the Fondazione Michelangelo and was done and analysed in collaboration with F Hoﬀmann-La Roche. F HoﬀmannLa Roche funded the study, provided study drugs, and was involved in study design, protocol development, regulatory and ethics approvals, safety monitoring and reporting, data management, and data analysis. All authors had full access 28 

to all data in the study and had ﬁnal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 

Results Patients were enrolled across 59 centres in 16 countries from Dec 17, 2007, to Dec 22, 2009. Figure 1 shows patient disposition. Of 417 eligible patients, 392 underwent surgery as planned, and all those who did so had a valid assessment of pathological response. Baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups (table 1). The baseline median tumour size at clinical breast examination was at least 50 mm across all groups of the study (table 1). The median docetaxel dose intensity was very close to the maximum planned dose intensity of 31·25 mg/m² per week in all groups of patients (appendix). A pathological complete response was noted in 31 of 107 women (29·0%, 95% CI 20·6–38·5) given trastuzumab plus docetaxel (group A) compared with 49 of 107 (45·8%, 36·1–55·7) given pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel (group B; table 2; p=0·0141). By comparison, 23 of 96 women (24·0%, 15·8–33·7) given pertuzumab plus docetaxel (group D) had a pathological complete response, as did 18 of 107 (16·8%, 10·3–25·3) women treated with both anti-HER2 antibodies but without chemotherapy (group C; table 2). Consistent with ﬁndings in previous studies,14 fewer pathological complete responses were noted in tumours that were hormone receptor-positive (table 2). In patients with hormone receptor-negative tumours, pathological complete responses were noted in 36 of 57 women (63·2%) www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 13 January 2012

who received both anti-HER2 antibodies and chemotherapy (group B; table 2). In group C (without chemotherapy), 15 of 55 (27·3%) patients with hormone receptor-negative tumours had complete eradication of the tumour in the breast, which was a greater proportion than that achieved in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours in all groups (table 2). The proportion of patients who were lymph node-negative at surgery and achieved pathological complete response in the breast was highest in group B (table 2). The number of dissected and positive lymph nodes at surgery is shown in the appendix. Most patients achieved an objective response (complete response or partial response) in the primary lesion (table 3). As noted for pathological complete responses, the greatest clinical response was reported in group B (table 3). Few patients had insuﬃcient therapeutic response (as per investigators’ decision) during the neoadjuvant treatment period, although numbers were higher in group C where patients received both anti-HER2 antibodies without chemotherapy (no patients in group A, one [0·9%] patient in group B, seven [6·5%] in group C, and one [1·0%] in group D). The most frequently occurring adverse events were alopecia, neutropenia, diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, rash, and mucosal inﬂammation (table 4). Most adverse events were of grades 1–2. Nearly all of the most frequent adverse events were deemed possibly related to study treatment. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and leucopenia, as expected for treatment with docetaxel (table 5). The incidence of febrile neutropenia was 7–8% in groups A, B, and D; no patient had febrile neutropenia in group C (without chemotherapy). The overall incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher was lowest in group C (eight [2%] of 326 events), in which no chemotherapy was given and ranged from 12% (97 of 803 events; group B) to 14% (110 of 806 events; group A) in the other three treatment groups. The number of serious adverse events was similar in groups A, B, and D (15–20 serious adverse events per group in 10–17% of patients), but lower in group C (four serious adverse events in 4% of patients; table 5). Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were the most frequent serious adverse events. Two patients died during the neoadjuvant phase (table 5). One death was caused by fulminant hepatitis possibly related to treatment, which began after treatment cycle 4 in group B. This patient had a high body-mass index, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The other death occurred in group D; this patient died of lung metastases and progressive disease. The possible presence of lung metastases was not evident at randomisation. Figure 2 shows the relative LVEF changes from baseline in the four groups of the study. The mean maximum decrease in LVEF measurement was low (4–5%) and was balanced across treatment groups. No signiﬁcant change was detected when pertuzumab was added to trastuzumab and no patient had an LVEF decrease to less than 40% at www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 13 January 2012

Group C=pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Group D=pertuzumab plus docetaxel. LVEF assessments by echocardiography or multiple gated acquisition were planned at baseline and cycles 2 and 4; some patients had additional assessments. The relative LVEF change from baseline is shown for each patient in the four treatment groups. *Patient who developed congestive heart failure and discontinued treatment. 

Of these six patients, all had LVEF improvements to more than 50% and a decrease of less than 10% by cycle 4, with the exception of the one patient in group C who discontinued treatment because of congestive heart failure. This patient had a history of hypertension and angina pectoris, had a coronary arterial stent in situ, and was receiving digoxin at baseline. The patient’s enrolment into study was a protocol violation. 

Discussion In this study, a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of women given neoadjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel achieved a pathological complete response in the breast than did those given trastuzumab and docetaxel alone, as measured after only 12 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment in a population in which a third of patients were aﬀected by locally advanced disease. Although pertuzumab plus docetaxel was eﬃcacious, the combination of chemotherapy with both antibodies was more active than chemotherapy with either antibody alone. The beneﬁt of dual HER2 targeting has also been 30 

noted in the NeoALTTO study,18 in which six cycles of neoadjuvant trastuzumab and the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor lapatinib plus chemotherapy resulted in pathological complete responses in 51·3% of patients, compared with 29·5% of those given trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.18 Of note, in our study, pathological complete response was achieved in 17% of patients given trastuzumab and pertuzumab without chemotherapy, suggesting that a proportion of HER2-positive tumours can be eradicated without chemotherapy, which might have immediate use for women who cannot receive cytotoxic drugs. However, a third of patients did not respond to the regimen of both antibodies. This could be partly due to the short duration of neoadjuvant treatment. Indeed, results from a study in patients with metastatic breast cancer showed that the conversion of stable disease to objective response was a late event in many patients.11 The absence of response to the two antibodies in a sizeable proportion of patients highlights the need for predictive biomarkers of response in view of pursuing this chemotherapy-free option. www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 13 January 2012

A potential limitation of the study is that 6% (25 of 417) of patients, mostly in the chemotherapy-free group, did not undergo surgery as planned. Most of these patients did not achieve a suﬃcient therapeutic response. Tumour eradication was higher in hormone receptornegative than in hormone receptor-positive patients. This ﬁnding has been reported previously,14 is similar to observations with chemotherapy treatment,19 and is usually attributed to the companion chemotherapy. However, in this study, a higher percentage of hormone receptornegative patients achieved a pathological complete response across all groups, including those patients who did not receive chemotherapy, indicating that the diﬀerent likelihood of response according to hormone receptor status is an intrinsic characteristic of the tumours. Of note, more patients with hormone receptor-negative tumours achieved pathological complete response with the doublet of pertuzumab and trastuzumab than did those with hormone receptor-positive tumours in all groups. As the duration of neoadjuvant therapy was short, the true beneﬁt in hormone receptor-positive patients might be obscured and should be assessed with longer-term therapy.14,20,21 A recent meta-analysis22 of neoadjuvant studies showed that pathological complete response is better correlated with long-term outcome in patients with hormone receptornegative rather than hormone receptor-positive disease.22 The phase 2 design and the small sample size of our study will prevent future analyses of outcome in the overall population and in subsets; thus, the study will not contribute to clariﬁcation of the actual predictive role of pathological complete response according to hormone receptor status. Our trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group resulted in a lower rate of pathological complete response than that in other studies that adopted longer regimens and sequential chemotherapy.14,16 After surgery, all patients in our study received adjuvant conventional treatment including anthracyclines and trastuzumab for 1 year in total to ensure optimum drug therapy. The tolerability of the triplet regimen of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel was similar to that of conventional trastuzumab plus docetaxel.23 As expected, bone-marrow toxic eﬀects and febrile neutropenia occurred in all groups that included docetaxel.23 Cardiac feasibility was good, although a longer observation period will be needed to exclude any further risk from the addition of pertuzumab. The only event of serious cardiac toxic eﬀects (congestive heart failure) was noted in a woman who enrolled despite having coronary stents and receiving digoxin for a pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Cardiac tolerability in the adjuvant phase will be presented separately. Of note, pertuzumab and trastuzumab without docetaxel were associated with only a few adverse events of grade 3 or higher. Because pertuzumab blocks the heterodimer formation responsible for signalling via EGFR and HER2, diarrhoea and skin rash can occur, as noted with other drugs that aﬀect the same pathway, such as the www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 13 January 2012 

Panel: Research in context Systematic review We searched PubMed with the terms “trastuzumab”, “HER2” and “breast cancer” for articles published between 1998, and 2011. Results were manually sorted and restricted to landmark ﬁndings regarding relevance to the treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer. HER2-targeted therapy with trastuzumab is established as the standard of care for HER2-positive early breast cancer, based on four randomised phase 3 trials.3,4,26 The notion of targeting the HER2 receptor with two drugs with diﬀerent mechanisms of action is based on solid preclinical data and requires assessment in clinical trials. Neoadjuvant clinical studies allow rapid assessment of the beneﬁt of new treatment regimens, with pathological complete responses acting as a surrogate marker for long-term outcomes.12,14,15 The NeoSphere study was done to assess whether a blockade of the HER2 signalling pathway with pertuzumab and trastuzumab could improve treatment outcomes in this clinical setting and gain insights for future studies. Interpretation In the NeoSphere study, following only four cycles of neoadjuvant treatment, pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel resulted in complete tumour eradication in the breast in signiﬁcantly more women than for those treated with trastuzumab plus docetaxel alone. Importantly, the combination of pertuzumab with trastuzumab and docetaxel did not result in any additional safety signals. Thus, this triplet combination could be an attractive proposition for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Additional studies in the neoadjuvant setting—eg, NeoALTTO18—have also conﬁrmed the potential of dual HER2-targeted therapy. Taken together, these results suggest that diﬀerent mechanisms of action of HER2-targeting drugs could provide a more comprehensive blockade of the signalling pathway when combined. NeoSphere also examined a chemotherapy-free regimen of pertuzumab and trastuzumab that resulted in pathological complete responses in a proportion of women and a favourable safety proﬁle. These ﬁndings suggest a potential future role for chemotherapy-free HER2-targeted therapy, although such regimens require further clinical investigation and the assessment of predictive biomarkers. 

tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, lapatinib and neratinib.24,25 In the chemotherapy-free group of this study, diarrhoea and skin rash occurred in less than 30% of patients and were of grade 2 or less. The tolerability proﬁle of the chemotherapyfree regimen is similar to that reported in women with metastatic breast cancer,11 in whom the higher incidence of grade 1–2 diarrhoea and rash (>60%) than in NeoSphere could be due to the extensive previous treatment and the longer duration of study therapy (median of nine cycles of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab).11 The success of trastuzumab has prompted the search for more HER2-directed therapies (panel).24,27–30 The growing list of drugs, the increasing number of promising permutations of new and established treatments, and the rising size and costs of adjuvant trials challenge the conventional approach to investigating every new candidate treatment. The neoadjuvant setting is ideally suited for rapidly testing new HER2-targeted therapies while providing data on pathological response that could act as a surrogate for long-term eﬃcacy.14,15 Data obtained from NeoSphere supported the conduct and informed the design of an ongoing adjuvant trial with pertuzumab (NCT01358877), and illustrated the potential of the neoadjuvant approach in new drug development. 31
