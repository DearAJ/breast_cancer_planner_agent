Summary Background Trastuzumab—a humanised monoclonal antibody against HER2—has been shown to improve diseasefree survival after chemotherapy in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer. We investigated the drug’s eﬀect on overall survival after a median follow-up of 2 years in the Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) study. Methods HERA is an international multicentre randomised trial that compared 1 or 2 years of trastuzumab treatment with observation alone after standard neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy in women with HER2-positive node positive or high-risk node negative breast cancer. 5102 women participated in the trial; we analysed data from 1703 women who had been randomised for treatment with trastuzumab for 1 year and 1698 women from the control group, with median follow-up of 23·5 months (range 0–48 months). The primary endpoint of the trial was diseasefree survival. Here, we assess overall survival, a secondary endpoint. Analyses were done on an intent-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2005–002385–11. Findings 97 (5·7%) patients randomised to observation alone and 58 (3·4%) patients randomised to 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab were lost to follow-up. 172 women stopped trastuzumab prematurely. 59 deaths were reported for trastuzumab and 90 in the control group. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of death with trastuzumab compared with observation alone was 0·66 (95% CI 0·47–0·91; p=0·0115). 218 disease-free survival events were reported with trastuzumab compared with 321 in the control group. The unadjusted HR for the risk of an event with trastuzumab compared with observation alone was 0·64 (0·54–0·76; p<0·0001). Interpretation Our results show that 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy has a signiﬁcant overall survival beneﬁt after a median follow-up of 2 years. The emergence of this beneﬁt after only 2 years reinforces the importance of trastuzumab in the treatment of women with HER2-positive early breast cancer. 

Introduction Trastuzumab (Herceptin; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) is a humanised monoclonal antibody that is targeted against the extracellular domain of the HER2 transmembrane growth factor receptor.1 Ampliﬁcation of the HER2 gene and overexpression of the receptor occurs in around 15–25% of women with early breast cancer, and is associated with an aggressive disease course.2,3 Trastuzumab has been shown to be of overall survival beneﬁt to women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer administered alone4,5 or in combination with chemotherapy.6,7 The Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial (Breast International Group 0101) is one of several large trials designed to test the eﬃcacy of trastuzumab in the adjuvant (ie, postsurgery) treatment of women with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Results of a ﬁrst planned interim analysis with a median 1-year follow-up showed that trastuzumab given every 3 weeks for 1 year after adjuvant or neoadjuvant (ie, presurgery) chemotherapy achieved a signiﬁcant improvement in disease-free survival compared with women treated with adjuvant chemotherapy alone, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·54.8 www.thelancet.com Vol 369 January 6, 2007 

The combined analysis of two similar North American trials (North Central Cancer Treatment Group Trial N9831 and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-31) has also shown a signiﬁcant improvement in disease-free survival for trastuzumab given concurrently with four courses of paclitaxel either every week or every 3 weeks after a combination of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and continued for 1 year compared with the same chemotherapy schedule alone.9 A fourth adjuvant trastuzumab trial, known as BCIRG 006, has also shown much the same disease-free survival beneﬁt when trastuzumab is given either with docetaxel after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide or with docetaxel and carboplatin.10 Finally, a ﬁfth, much smaller, trial has also shown an improvement in disease-free survival after only 9 weeks of trastuzumab given at the start of treatment concurrently with adjuvant chemotherapy.11 The magnitude of the beneﬁt, with a reduction in the early risk of recurrence of around 50% in all these trials, has led to the widespread use of trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy. However, this use has been criticised by some

because the ﬁndings arise from interim analyses, followup is short, and signiﬁcant overall survival beneﬁt has not been shown in any stand alone trial.12 Our aim is to report an analysis of overall survival, together with an updated assessment of disease-free survival, in the HERA trial with a median 2-year follow-up. 

Methods Patients The study design, eligibility criteria, treatment schedules, monitoring, and statistical analysis plan have been described in detail elsewhere.8 Brieﬂy, the HERA trial is an international intergroup open-label phase III randomised trial involving women with centrally conﬁrmed HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry score 3 or ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridisation positive) early stage invasive breast cancer who had completed local regional therapy and a minimum of four courses of predeﬁned standard adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemo-

therapy. Eligibility criteria included node-positive disease or node-negative disease if the pathological tumour size was larger than 1 cm. Women with locally advanced disease including inﬂammatory breast cancers were excluded. Women with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 55% after completion of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, congestive cardiac failure, or other major cardiac problems8 were excluded. The ethics review boards at all the participating institutions approved the study protocol and all patients gave written informed consent. 

Procedures After local regional therapy (surgery with or without radiotherapy), patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: observation only, 8 mg/kg trastuzumab given intravenously by 90 minute infusion as a loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 1 year, or the same schedule of trastuzumab for 2 years (not reported here). Randomisation was done within 7 weeks from day 1 of the last chemotherapy cycle or 6 weeks from the end of radiotherapy or deﬁnitive surgery, whichever was the last. A minimisation procedure was used with stratiﬁcation according to region of the world, age, nodal status, title of chemotherapy, and hormone receptor status together with intention to use endocrine therapy. When a signiﬁcant disease-free survival in favour of 1 year’s treatment with trastuzumab over observation alone emerged with a median follow-up of 1 year,8 a protocol amendment was made after recruitment had been completed (except for the last ﬁve patients) to allow women in the observation group the option of switching to trastuzumab, irrespective of the interval since randomisation. Women who opted to switch were also given the further choice of a secondary randomisation to 1 year versus 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab. The primary endpoint of the trial was disease-free survival (deﬁned as time from randomisation to the ﬁrst occurrence of any of the following events: recurrence of breast cancer at any site; the development of ipsilateral or contralateral breast cancer including ductal carcinoma in situ but not lobular carcinoma in situ; second nonbreast malignant disease other than basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix; or death from any cause without documentation of a cancer-related event), and the eﬀect of trastuzumab on this endpoint has been described previously.8 Overall survival was a secondary endpoint; other secondary eﬃcacy endpoints included time to recurrence, time to distant recurrence, and safety, including cardiac safety. Criteria for interrupting or stopping trastuzumab therapy on the basis of cardiotoxicity or other side-eﬀects have been previously described.8 Severe congestive heart failure, which does not include death from cardiac causes, was deﬁned as New York Heart Association grade III or IV functional class www.thelancet.com Vol 369 January 6, 2007

conﬁrmed by a cardiologist and a decrease in LVEF of at least 10% below baseline and to less than 50%. Symptomatic congestive heart failure was deﬁned as symptomatic congestive heart failure conﬁrmed by a cardiologist and LVEF less than 50% and a decrease in LVEF of at least 10% from baseline. A signiﬁcant LVEF drop was deﬁned as a decrease in LVEF of 10 points or more from baseline to a level below 50 points. A conﬁrmed signiﬁcant LVEF drop was deﬁned as an asymptomatic (NYHA class I) or mildly symptomatic (NYHA class II) signiﬁcant drop in LVEF which is also conﬁrmed on repeat LVEF assessment about 3 weeks after the ﬁrst documented drop, or as identiﬁed by the cardiac advisory board review.

All authors had access to all the data. The trials’ steering committee had ﬁnal responsibility to submit the manuscript for publication. 

Results 5102 women were recruited between December, 2001, and June, 2005, including 1698 in the observation group and 1703 assigned to receive 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab (ﬁgure 1). The baseline characteristics of patient tumours and treatment, updated from the 

Statistical analysis A target accrual of 4482 patients was planned to identify a 23% reduction in the risk of a disease-free survival event with 80% power with a two-sided level of signiﬁcance of 2·5% for both of the pairwise comparisons: 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab versus observation alone and 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab versus observation alone. 951 endpoint events were required for the ﬁnal analysis. One interim eﬃcacy analysis was planned after 475 events, the results of which, reviewed by the independent data monitoring committee in April, 2005, resulted in the initial HERA trial publication.8 The eﬃcacy analyses were done on an intention-totreat basis. χ² tests for categorical data and log-rank tests for time-to-event endpoints provided two-sided p values. Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CI. Statistical analyses were done with SAS version 8. In addition to the main intent-to-treat analysis, an analysis that censored women at the time of switching to trastuzumab has also been done to compensate for a potential eﬀect of delayed administration of trastuzumab. The independent data monitoring committee continues to review data about deaths, compliance, and safety every 6 months. On the basis of a review in March, 2006, they recommended that overall survival results for observation alone versus treatment with trastuzumab for 1 year with a median follow-up of 2 years should be made public. Results for the group of patients treated with trastuzumab for 2 years remain blinded because the comparison with the group treated for 1 year continues to mature. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2005–002385–11. 

Role of the funding source The trial was sponsored and funded by Roche. The collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data were done entirely independently, under the auspices of the Breast International Group. The corresponding author www.thelancet.com Vol 369 January 6, 2007

original publication, are shown in table 1. 97 (5·7%) patients randomly assigned to observation alone and 58 (3·4%) patients randomly assigned to 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab were lost to follow-up. As of May 15, 2006, 861 women in the observation group had switched to trastuzumab. In the February, 2006, analysis that censored patients at the time of moving to trastuzumab, the median time that had elapsed from the point of switching was 2·6 months. 705 patients originally randomly assigned to observation alone were censored for disease-free survival and overall survival at the date of switching treatment. Results from the censored analysis are much the same as those from the intention-to-treat analysis. A 100

After a median follow-up of 23·5 months (range 0–48 months), 539 disease-free survival events had been recorded in the two groups. Table 2 shows data about the site of ﬁrst disease-free survival events. The unadjusted HR for the risk of an event in the trastuzumab group compared with the observation group was 0·64 (95% CI 0·54–0·76; p<0·0001 by the log rank test), which corresponds to an absolute disease-free survival beneﬁt of 6·3% (80·6% vs 74·3%) at 3 years (ﬁgure 2A). The HR for the disease-free survival beneﬁt by censored analysis was 0·63 (0·53–0·75; p<0·0001). 149 deaths occurred in the two groups; more deaths occurred in the observation group than in the trastuzumab group (table 2). The unadjusted HR for the risk of death in the trastuzumab group compared with observation alone was 0·66 (0·47–0·91; p=0·0115 by the log rank test); which corresponds with an absolute overall survival beneﬁt of 2·7% (92·4% vs 89·7%) at 3 years (ﬁgure 2B). The HR for overall survival by censored analysis was 0·63 (0·45–0·87; p=0·0051). More distant metastases were reported in the observation group than in the group receiving trastuzumab (table 2); the HR for time to a distant recurrence in the trastuzumab group compared with the observation group was 0·60 (0·49–0·73; p<0·0001 by log rank test). These results correspond to an absolute time to distant recurrence event-free survival beneﬁt of 6·3% at 3 years (85·7% vs 79·4%, p<0·0001). There was no evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the relative treatment eﬀect on disease-free survival between subgroups, and there was no evidence of any subgroup in which trastuzumab was seen to be less eﬃcacious than observation alone (ﬁgure 3). All CIs overlap the overall result. The annualised hazard rates for disease-free survival for both groups from the point of randomisation are shown in ﬁgure 4. An increase in risk during the ﬁrst year for the observation group was seen, although this risk falls in the second year and beyond. Trastuzumab suppresses this increased early risk. Although the HR between the two groups decreases beyond the second year, there continues to be less chance of a disease-free survival event with trastuzumab compared with observation alone at all points up to 3 years. There were more episodes of at least one grade 3 or grade 4 adverse event and of serious adverse events with trastuzumab than in the observation group (p<0·0001; table 3). The only grade 3 or grade 4 adverse event experienced by ﬁve or more patients in the observation group was hypertension (n=5). The grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events experienced by ﬁve or more patients in the trastuzumab group were hypertension (12), depression (8), diarrhoea (7), congestive cardiac failure (7), vomiting (6), arthralgia (6), cardiac failure (5), hot ﬂush (5), headache (5), and back pain (5). There was a higher incidence of fatal adverse events in the trastuzumab group than in the observation group www.thelancet.com Vol 369 January 6, 2007

(p=0·1601; table 3). However, the nature of the fatal adverse events did not seem to have any causal relation with trastuzumab. Of the 172 women who stopped trastuzumab prematurely, 115 (6·8%) stopped because of safety issues, 43 (2·5%) because of refusal, and 14 (0·8%) because of other reasons. As described previously,13 there was one cardiac death in the observation group and none with trastuzumab. Severe congestive heart failure occurred in more women on trastuzumab than in the observation group (p<0·0001); likewise, symptomatic congestive heart failure (including severe congestive heart failure) occurred in more patients on trastuzumab than in those in the observation group www.thelancet.com Vol 369 January 6, 2007 

(table 4). Furthermore, a conﬁrmed signiﬁcant LVEF drop occurred in more women on trastuzumab than in those in the observation group (p<0·0001; table 4). 72 (4·3%) women discontinued trastuzumab because of cardiac problems. A more detailed account of cardiotoxicity in this trial is being prepared. 

Discussion Our results indicate that trastuzumab shows a signiﬁcant overall survival beneﬁt in early breast cancer over observation alone after chemotherapy. Such a survival beneﬁt after only 2 years of follow-up is unusual in breast cancer trials. For example, adjuvant chemotherapy is of 33

major importance in the treatment of breast cancer and has achieved a long-term survival beneﬁt of 38% for younger women,14 but the key early trial for such treatment had not begun to show a substantial survival diﬀerence after only 2 years of follow-up,15 nor have any subsequent chemotherapy trials. In the modern era, the same is true for the aromatase inhibitors, widely deemed to be a major development in adjuvant endocrine therapy.16–18 Only tamoxifen—the most successful treatment ever developed 0·20

for breast cancer—showed a similar survival beneﬁt in such a short period.19 Thus, the early evidence of an overall survival beneﬁt in the HERA trial after only 2 years of follow-up reinforces the importance of trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of women with HER2-positive early breast cancer.20 That this survival diﬀerence will not be sustained with further follow-up is a possibility; however, there are few precedents for this in work already published on adjuvant therapies for early breast cancer. Furthermore, after the publication of disease-free survival results from HERA with a median follow-up of 12 months,8 we estimated that the chance of losing statistical signiﬁcance with longer follow-up was less than 20%. This estimate was calculated on the basis of division of HRs for disease-free survival into a ﬁxed component already observed and a random component, assuming that the risk for the observation group fell to the level seen in the trastuzumab group and follow-up was continued for a further 4 years. Because more events have occurred in the observation group than in the trastuzumab group during the subsequent 12 months, and the HR has fallen for both arms beyond 2 years, the chance of loss of signiﬁcance remains below 20%. The same arguments pertain for overall survival. The one confounding issue is the recent cross-over of patients in the control group to trastuzumab; it could be that, with longer follow-up, a signiﬁcant overall survival beneﬁt might be maintained in the censored analysis, but not the intention-to-treat analysis because of this crossover. The NSABP B-31 trial compared treatment with trastuzumab for 1 year starting concurrently with four courses of paclitaxel after a combination of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with the same chemotherapy schedule alone.9 When data from this trial were combined with results from two similar groups in the NCCTG 9831 trial, a signiﬁcant overall survival beneﬁt was noted after a median follow-up of 2 years and with an HR of 0·67 in favour of trastuzumab,9 which is much the same as that recorded here. The consistently high reductions in the risk of breast cancer recurrence of around 50% seen in these two trials, together with that noted in a fourth large adjuvant trastuzumab trial, BCIRG 006,10 suggest that these results will probably translate into stand-alone survival gains in the near future. Our exploratory subgroup analysis suggests that all subgroups of women seem to beneﬁt from trastuzumab. In particular, there is so far no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in eﬃcacy between women with node-positive and nodenegative disease, nor between those receiving adjuvant compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Whether diﬀerent patterns of treatment eﬀect emerge for some subgroups with further follow-up remains to be seen. That the risk of cardiotoxicity remains low is encouraging, and the absence of any substantial evidence of an increase in cumulative cardiotoxicity beyond 1 year has also been shown in the B-31 trial.21 The overall risk of severe congestive heart failure reported here is lower than www.thelancet.com Vol 369 January 6, 2007

that reported in the B-31 trial (0·6% vs 4·1%),21 as is the proportion of women who stopped treatment because of cardiac problems (4·3% and, of evaluable trastuzumab patients, 15·6%). These ﬁndings could be a result of the longer time interval between stopping chemotherapy with anthracyclines and starting trastuzumab in the HERA trial than in B-31, or the requirement of a postchemotherapy LVEF of 55% or more before enrolment in HERA, or both. In this context, one should note that the incidence of cardiotoxicity in the anthracycline followed by trastuzumab group of the BCIRG 006 trial was much the same as that in B-31, but substantially lower in the trastuzumab group that did not receive anthracycline.10 Thus far, the only data for cardiotoxicity associated with trastuzumab continued for more than a year is in metastatic breast cancer: in one recent study involving 218 patients with a median treatment duration of 21 months and a median follow-up of 32·6 months, 49 (28%) experienced a cardiac event and 19 (10·9%) grade 3 cardiotoxicity.22 However, most patients improved after withdrawal of trastuzumab and appropriate treatment, and there was only one cardiac death. One should note that these patients would often be less ﬁt than those in HERA and other adjuvant trials because of their metastatic disease, and some would have received a greater cumulative dose of anthracycline chemotherapy. Two major questions remain for adjuvant trastuzumab. The ﬁrst is whether trastuzumab started concurrently with taxane chemotherapy (as in the USA trials) is better than trastuzumab starting sequentially after completion of chemotherapy (as here). The NCCTG N9831 trial addresses this issue—this trial includes a third group given sequential trastuzumab. Preliminary data suggest that sequential treatment might be less eﬀective than concurrent treatment,23 but this was an unplanned comparison with low statistical power, and longer follow-up is needed for conﬁrmation. In this context, one should note that the median time from diagnosis of breast cancer to starting trastuzumab in the HERA trial was 8·5 months, which could have aﬀected eﬃcacy or resulted in some patients with very high-risk disease relapsing before the opportunity arose to enter the trial. The second issue concerns the duration of trastuzumab treatment. A third group in the HERA trial, in which patients are treated with trastuzumab for 2 years, addresses this issue. That trastuzumab suppresses the increased early hazard rate seen in the observation group during the ﬁrst year, but has less eﬀect thereafter, might be of relevance (ﬁgure 4). This ﬁnding supports our decision to compare 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment. However, one should also note that a small Finnish trial involving 232 women has reported a diseasefree survival beneﬁt with 9 weeks of trastuzumab treatment given concurrently with chemotherapy at the start of treatment.11 The HR from this trial (0·42, 95% CI 0·21–0·83; p=0·01) is within the same range as those recorded in trials of trastuzumab treatment for 1 year, but www.thelancet.com Vol 369 January 6, 2007 

the small number of women involved, together with the wide CI, require conﬁrmatory data. The data presented here conﬁrm earlier reports that trastuzumab, a rationally designed biological therapy that is targeted against a speciﬁc ampliﬁed gene (HER2) and its over-expressed receptor protein, is of beneﬁt to women with HER2-positive breast cancer when given after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. The survival beneﬁt that has emerged over such a short period emphasises the potential of this approach and underlines the importance of developing further speciﬁc targeted therapies in breast and other cancers.
