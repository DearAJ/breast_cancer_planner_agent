Background Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab—the standard adjuvant treatment. We investigated the eﬃcacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis. Methods This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial. Women outpatients from 405 centres in 33 countries with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratiﬁed by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status. Investigators, site staﬀ, and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322. Findings Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576). After a median follow-up of 47·4 months (range 0·4–60·0) in the lapatinib group and 48·3 (0·7–61·3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·83, 95% CI 0·70–1·00; p=0·053). Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive. 157 (13%) of 1230 conﬁrmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0·82, 95% 0·67–1·00; p=0·04). Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3–4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]). Interpretation Our data show that there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population. However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2positive disease conﬁrmed by central ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal beneﬁt with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival. Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab. Funding GlaxoSmithKline. 

Introduction Standard adjuvant treatment for HER2-positive (ERBB2positive) breast cancers consists of chemotherapy and 1 year of intravenous trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor.1 In the absence of trastuzumab, patients with HER2-positive breast cancer have unfavourable clinical outcomes, with a relative risk for disease-free survival of 2·0 and overall survival of 2·7.2,3 Given concurrently with chemotherapy, trastuzumab reduces the risk of death by 33–44% compared with patients with HER2-positive tumours not receiving trastuzumab, but causes asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction in 18% of patients and severe cardiac dysfunction in 1–4%.4–9 Globally, many women do not receive trastuzumab for HER2-positive primary breast cancer for either 

socioeconomic or logistic reasons.10 When started as late as 2–6 years after diagnosis, adjuvant endocrine treatment improves disease-free survival.11 An antiHER2 treatment that could be administered either at diagnosis or later, as an alternative to trastuzumab, could be beneﬁcial. Lapatinib—an oral, small molecule inhibitor of HER1 and HER2—is approved for use in combination with capecitabine for patients with HER2positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab.12,13 Lapatinib is generally safe and well tolerated, although because it is a small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitor it causes frequent mild-to-moderate diarrhoea, skin rash, and transient mild increases of liver aminotransferase concentrations, as well as rare symptomatic cardiac toxic eﬀects.12,13 We investigated the use of adjuvant lapatinib www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 14 January 2013

Methods 

Procedures 

Study design and participants 

Enrolled patients were assessed once every 3 months by clinical assessment, routine blood tests, echocardiogram, or multigated acquisition scan. All participants completed the Short Form-36 version 2 questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life at baseline and every 6 months for 24 months. Information about toxic eﬀects was recorded. After completion of 12 months of treatment or drug withdrawal, patients were followed up once every 3 months until 2 years after diagnosis, once every 6 months until 5 years after diagnosis, and once per year thereafter. Patients had a mammogram every year throughout treatment and follow-up. Locoregional recurrence, metastatic disease, and second primary cancers were deﬁned radiologically, pathologically, or clinically. Recurrences and second primary cancers were dated from when they were ﬁrst detected. Safety was reviewed every 6 months by the independent data and safety monitoring committee. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, with events deﬁned as: locoregional and distant recurrence; contralateral breast cancer (including ductal carcinoma in situ); other second primary cancer (excluding carcinoma of the skin, melanoma in situ or carcinoma in situ of the cervix); and death from any cause without a previous event (recurrence of breast cancer or second primary cancer). Secondary endpoints were: time to ﬁrst recurrence— deﬁned as ﬁrst occurrence of disease in sites deﬁned for disease-free survival; time to distant recurrence; overall survival (including death from any cause); time to CNS recurrence; health-related quality of life; and toxic eﬀects (toxic eﬀects both reported by the patient and detected in chemical and haematological tests, cardiac dysfunction, and assessment of QT/QTc interval). We also assessed disease-free survival in predeﬁned subgroups and within 

The TEACH (Tykerb Evaluation After CHemotherapy) trial was a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were hospital outpatients at 405 centres in 33 countries worldwide. Eligibility criteria were: age 18 years or older; histologically conﬁrmed stage I–IIIC invasive breast cancer that was HER2-positive (deﬁned locally as 3+ by immunohistochemistry or HER2 ampliﬁcation by ﬂuorescent in-situ hybridisation, or centrally by ﬂuorescent insitu hybridisation [Path Vysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit, Abbott Molecular; HER2:CEP-17 ratio ≥2 considered ampliﬁed]); adequate locoregional and systemic treatment (appendix); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function and cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range of normal, measured by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scans. Women were eligible for randomisation if they were disease free at any time after primary treatment and had completed adjuvant chemotherapy. For all the inclusion criteria, see appendix. Exclusion criteria were: previous treatment with trastuzumab; clinical or radiological evidence of local or regional recurrence or metastatic disease; history of other breast cancer (including ductal carcinoma in situ); other previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancer, treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours with no evidence of disease for 5 years); and uncontrolled medical disorder. For all the exclusion criteria, see appendix. The study was approved by each centres’ ethics committee. Patients gave written, informed consent. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.

Randomisation and masking We randomly assigned women to receive oral lapatinib (1500 mg) or placebo (in a 1:1 ratio), daily for 12 months or until disease recurrence, development of a second primary cancer, or unacceptable toxic eﬀects. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence and was stratiﬁed. To assign a participant, the site staﬀ entered the patient’s number, time since initial diagnosis, time from completion of primary adjuvant chemotherapy, hormone receptor status (oestrogenreceptor positive, progesterone-receptor positive, or both vs oestrogen-receptor negative and progesteronereceptor negative), and lymph node involvement to obtain a randomisation number and treatment group assignment. Stratiﬁcation factors were time since diagnosis (≤4 years or >4 years), lymph node involvement at www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 14 January 2013

Table 1: Baseline characteristics 

Events (version 3.0). A serious event was any event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospital admittance or extended current hospital admittance, resulted in disability or incapacity, resulted in congenital abnormalities or birth defects, and others, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or admission to hospital but which might jeopardise the patient or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the deﬁnition. Additional protocol-deﬁned criteria were: all grade 4 laboratory abnormalities; severe symptomatic congestive heart failure and cardiac death; any grade 3 signs or symptoms of pneumonitis; and alanine aminotransferase concentration more than three times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin concentration more than twice the upper limit of normal (>35% direct bilirubin; bilirubin fractionation required). 

Statistical analysis We calculated that we would need to enrol 3000 women and have 463 disease-free survival events for 80% power (using a two sided α of 0·05) to detect a 23% (hazard ratio www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 14 January 2013

Results The number of patients screened was not captured in the electronic database. Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women from 33 countries were enrolled and assigned treatment (ﬁgure 1). 14 patients withdrew before treatment (nine withdrew consent, one had left ventricular ejection fraction of 53% and a lower limit of normal of 55%, one had increased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase concentrations, one was taking a prohibited drug, two because of investigator decision), and were thus excluded from the intention-totreat population, which consisted of 1571 women in the www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 14 January 2013

[HR] 0·769) reduction in disease-free survival.14 We assumed that yearly recurrence for patients taking placebo was 9·6%. We did an interim analysis of eﬃcacy and futility when 309 events were reached. The intention-to-treat population included all participants who had received at least one dose of study medication. We analysed disease-free survival and overall survival for each of the subgroups deﬁned by the randomisation strata. We also did a post hoc analysis of the retrospectively deﬁned population of participants whose tumours were ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridisation positive by central HER2 assessment. We used a log-rank test to assess the primary endpoint in the stratiﬁed intention-to-treat population. We also did a Cox regression analysis of the primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat population with covariates of randomisation strata, age, and stage of disease. Separate Cox regression models were used to assess the eﬀect of treatment on disease-free survival in each of the predeﬁned strata. Secondary endpoints of overall survival, time to ﬁrst recurrence, time to distant recurrence, and time to ﬁrst CNS recurrence were analysed in the intention-to-treat and the ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridisation positive populations with a competing risk method (in which all events other than the event of interest were treated as competing risks in the cumulative incidence curves). HRs were adjusted for baseline covariates. We used Fisher’s exact test to compare toxic eﬀects between groups for descriptive purposes only. All p values are two sided. 13 preplanned analyses were done, so we used a conservative signiﬁcance threshold of p=0·004. The cutoﬀ for collection of data was Sept 26, 2011. The data were analysed on Oct 21, 2011, with Unix SAS (version 9.1.3). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.

Loss to follow-up was not substantially diﬀerent between groups (ﬁgure 1). 3144 patients had HER2-positive disease as assessed by local or central laboratory. Central conﬁrmation by ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridisation was done for 3131 patients (some patients could not be assessed because of insuﬃcient tissue or failure to hybridise): 2490 (80%) were positive (1230 in the lapatinib group, 1260 in the placebo group), 425 (14%) were negative, and 216 (7%) were could not be assessed (table 1). The results of central conﬁrmation were much the same between countries (data not shown). Median follow-up was 47·4 months (range 0·4–60·0) in the lapatinib group and 48·3 months (0·7–61·3) in the placebo group. 210 (13%) of 1571 patients in the lapatinib group had a disease-free survival event versus 264 (17%) of 1576 patients in the placebo group (HR 0·83, 95% CI 0·70–1·00; p=0·053; ﬁgure 2).

than 1% in each group (n=4 for lapatinib, n=7 for placebo) had in-situ breast cancer. Distant recurrences—including in bone, liver, lung and lymph nodes—occurred in 125 (8%) patients in the lapatinib group and 156 (10%) patients in the placebo group (unadjusted HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·67–1·06; p=0·16). CNS as a site of ﬁrst recurrence occurred in 13 (<1%) of patients in the lapatinib group and 21 (1%) patients in the placebo group (unadjusted HR 0·65, 95% CI 0·33–1·28; p=0·24). Disease-free survival was better for patients with hormone-receptor-negative disease who were in the lapatinib group compared with those in the placebo group (p=0·006; ﬁgure 3); disease-free survival did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between groups for patients with hormonereceptor-positive disease (ﬁgure 3). Additionally, for patients assigned treatment within 1 year of diagnosis, those in the lapatinib group had a greater chance of disease-free survival than did those in the placebo group (p=0·04; ﬁgure 4), whereas the groups did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly for patients assigned treatment more than 1 year after diagnosis (ﬁgure 4). We did exploratory analyses of the 2490 patients with HER2-positive tumours conﬁrmed centrally by ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridisation (table 2). Disease-free survival events occurred in 157 (13%) of 1230 patients in 92 

the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 patients in the placebo group (table 2; HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·67–1·00; p=0·04). For patients whose HER2 status was unconﬁrmed by central review, the HR was 0·92 (95% CI 0·61–1·38; p=0·94). We also analysed the secondary endpoints for patients with centrally conﬁrmed HER2 status. Any recurrence or occurrence of contralateral breast cancer was less likely for patients taking lapatinib than for those taking placebo (table 2; p=0·033). Distant metastasis and CNS as the site of ﬁrst metastasis did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between groups (table 2). Table 3 shows self-reported adverse events in patients who received at least one dose of treatment. 1450 (92%) of 1573 patients who took lapatinib and 1193 (76%) of 1574 patients who took placebo reported any adverse event (p=0·003), mainly of grade 1 or 2. Diarrhoea, rash, nausea, fatigue, and hepatobiliary events were more common in the lapatinib group than in the placebo group (table 3). Overall, 99 (6%) patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) patients taking placebo had serious adverse events (28 [1·8%] vs 10 [<1%] had infections; 16 [1%] vs 14 [<1%] neoplasms; 17 [1%] vs 8 [<1%] gastrointestinal disorders; and 7 [<1%] vs 7 [<1%] cardiac events). Eight serious hepatobiliary events (<1%) occurred in the lapatinib group versus none in the placebo group. Occurrence of cardiac events did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between groups (table 3). No statistically signiﬁcant (p<0·05) or clinically meaningful diﬀerences existed between groups for summary quality-of-life scores relative to baseline (data not shown). No deaths were related to lapatinib treatment. 500 (32%) of 1571 patients in the lapatinib group and 252 (16%) of 1576 in the placebo group discontinued treatment before completion of 12 months. Reasons for early discontinuation included: adverse events (300 [19%] vs 82 [5%]), patient withdrawal (61 [4%] vs 31 [2%]), and disease recurrence (44 [3%] vs 68 [4%]). Median lapatinib adherence was 50·1 weeks (range 0·1–62·0 weeks) and 51·1 weeks (range 0·1–60·6) in the placebo group. Dose reductions were necessary for 243 (15%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 40 (3%) of 1574 taking placebo. 

Discussion After 4 years, disease-free survival did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between groups in our primary analysis. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in CNS recurrences and no evidence exists for a survival advantage with lapatinib treatment. Disease-free survival was better in the lapatinib group for women with hormone-receptornegative tumours and there was a suggestion of beneﬁt for patients who received lapatinib within a year of diagnosis, although this was not signiﬁcant at prespeciﬁed limits. However, an exploratory analysis in 2490 patients with centrally conﬁrmed HER2-positive tumours was suggestive of an improvement in diseasefree survival with lapatinib (panel). Our trial was designed to investigate whether lapatinib is beneﬁcial in a broad patient population who had not, www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 14 January 2013

or could not, receive adjuvant trastuzumab. Globally, many patients with HER2-positive breast cancer do not receive standard adjuvant anti-HER2 treatment and are precluded from the proven beneﬁt of adjuvant antiHER2 treatment.10 Reasons include being remote location from initial primary diagnosis or other logistic reasons, including drug unavailability or poor access to treatment because of health coverage reasons. Although we report a negative result for our primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat population, the recurrence rate of 3% versus the anticipated recurrence rate of 9·6% (appendix) suggests that we might have been studying a diﬀerent population (eg, in terms of hormone-receptor status, time since diagnosis) than we had planned, and perhaps lapatinib might have had a diﬀerent eﬀect in a diﬀerent population. Patients were eligible for randomisation if they locally assessed HER2-positive disease; however, only about 80% of these patients had HER2-positive disease according to subsequent central centrally conﬁrmed with ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridisation, although HER2 status was not assessed centrally by immunohistochemistry. This discrepancy is similar to that in the Breast Intergroup Trial N9831, which reported a concordance of 74% in 119 paraﬃn-embedded breast www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 14 January 2013 

tumour specimens, while in a retrospective combined analyses of samples from pivotal trials of adjuvant trastuzumab, a concordance of 81% was reported.15,16 Many factors could aﬀect these results, including the local choice of antibody, inexperience with scoring or deviation from standard immunohistochemistry techniques, assessment of non-invasive cancer components, and others. The poor concordance reported in previous trials and conﬁrmed in our trial, which included a large population from 33 countries, is of concern. Previous trials and our study showed a signiﬁcant beneﬁt of antiHER2 treatment in patients with centrally conﬁrmed HER2-positive disease. High rates of false positive and false negative HER2 results have major medical and ﬁnancial consequences and quality controls for local testing or central laboratory testing need to be improved. Some subgroups of patients have been previously reported to be more sensitive to anti-HER2 treatment than others, therefore we did exploratory analyses in these populations9 to explore treatment beneﬁt in subpopulations, rather than to detect heterogeneity of treatment eﬀect. For this goal, we were more concerned with preventing type II rather than type I error. Thus, no interactions were tested before the analyses. 93

Table 3: Self-reported acute toxic eﬀects (grade 1–4) 

Panel: Research in context Systematic review We searched Medline with the medical subject headings “breast cancer” and “anti-HER2 therapy”, and/or “trastuzumab”, and/or “lapatinib”, and/or “adjuvant” or “metastatic” to identify studies relevant to anti-HER2 treatment. We searched for studies published in English, between January 2000, and June 2012. We retrieved 426, of which we judged 27 to be most relevant. Interpretation Patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer beneﬁt from anti-HER2 treatment when given as up-front adjuvant treatment. Although disease-free survival did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between lapatinib and placebo groups in the intention-to-treat population, patients whose primary tumour is HER2-positive by central laboratory testing should be considered for anti-HER2 treatment even late after diagnosis. 

However, our results should be viewed with caution— since a substantial risk of inﬂated type I error exists— and interpreted in the context of other reported clinical trial analyses of these groups. In the prespeciﬁed subgroup of patients with hormone-receptor-negative tumours, lapatinib reduced the relative risk of diseasefree survival when given either soon after or delayed after adjuvant chemotherapy. By contrast, our trial showed no eﬀect of lapatinib in patients with hormonereceptor-positive disease. The beneﬁt of anti-HER2 treatment in the hormone-receptor-negative subgroup was also reported in a meta-analysis of up-front adjuvant trastuzumab in which the beneﬁt for patients with hormone-receptor-positive disease was less than 94 

that for patients with hormone-receptor-negative disease, although there was no statistically positive interaction between the subsets.9 By contrast, the report of the combined National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial B-31 and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial N9831, as well as the Breast Cancer International Research Group 006 report and later analysis of the HERA trial, did not ﬁnd a diﬀerence in beneﬁt between subgroups when anti-HER2 treatment was started concurrent with chemotherapy.14,17,18 However, in all these trials endocrine treatment was used concomitantly with trastuzumab. Our results for the hormone-receptor-positive subset are consistent with neoadjuvant trials, which tested shorter exposure to anti-HER2 treatment than we did, in which fewer pathological complete responses occurred compared with hormone-receptor-negative patients.19–22 Preclinical data suggest that cross-talk occurs between the oestrogen receptor and EGFR pathways, resulting in a stimulatory cycle that intensiﬁes activity in both pathways.23 In the setting of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, combination of anti-HER2 treatment concurrent with anti-oestrogen treatment is beneﬁcial, suggesting a possible positive interaction.13,24 In our study, most patients had hormone-receptor-positive tumours (59%), and 19% of hormone-receptor-positive patients did not receive concomitant endocrine treatment with lapatinib. This fact might have diminished the eﬃcacy of lapatinib in this group and attenuated disease-free survival. Of note, patients with www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 14 January 2013

hormone-receptor-negative tumours in our placebo group had a higher risk of relapse in the ﬁrst 2 years than in subsequent years, while hormone-receptorpositive patients had a steady risk of relapse over the follow-up period (ﬁgure 3). Lapatinib improved disease-free survival in patients starting treatment within 1 year of diagnosis in the intention-to-treat population. This ﬁnding could be a result of the eﬃcacy of lapatinib in hormone-receptornegative cancers, for which the risk of recurrence is highest in the 1–3 years after diagnosis and beneﬁt is strongest.25 The eﬀect of lapatinib early in the course of the disease, given either combined or sequentially with trastuzumab, is being investigated in the Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation (ALTTO) trial, in which the lapatinib monotherapy group was discontinued by an independent data and safety monitoring committee, who judged this group futile in terms of its non-inferiority over trastuzumab.26 Diarrhoea, nausea, rash, and dry skin were more common with lapatinib than with placebo. These toxic eﬀects were generally of mild to moderate grade, and contributed to treatment discontinuations in about a ﬁfth of patients taking lapatinib. Consistent with previous reports, hepatobiliary function disorders were uncommon (2% were grade 3–4), including increases of concentrations of liver aminotransferases, which were reversible after drug withdrawal in most patients. Quality of life did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between groups (data not shown; we will report these ﬁndings elsewhere). Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy remains the standard of care for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. This trial provides evidence of the eﬀect of adjuvant lapatinib on women with HER2-positive early breast cancer, justifying ongoing assessment in other trials, which are testing combined or sequential strategies with other anti-HER2 treatments to draw more deﬁnitive conclusions. From our exploratory analyses the apparent beneﬁt of treatment in women with hormonereceptor-negative disease and lack of beneﬁt in women with hormone-receptor-positive disease merit further investigation and in the meantime might help clinicians worldwide when considering anti-HER2 treatment for women who have not or can not receive standard adjuvant trastuzumab.
