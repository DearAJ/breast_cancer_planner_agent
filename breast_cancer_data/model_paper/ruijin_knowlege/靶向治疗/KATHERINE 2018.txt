BACKGROUND 

Patients who have residual invasive breast cancer after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–targeted therapy have a worse prognosis than those who have no residual cancer. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody–drug conjugate of trastuzumab and the cytotoxic agent emtansine (DM1), a maytansine derivative and microtubule inhibitor, provides benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer that was previously treated with chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy. METHODS 

We conducted a phase 3, open-label trial involving patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who were found to have residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla at surgery after receiving neoadjuvant therapy containing a taxane (with or without anthracycline) and trastuzumab. Patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant T-DM1 or trastuzumab for 14 cycles. The primary end point was invasive disease–free survival (defined as freedom from ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, distant recurrence, or death from any cause). RESULTS 

At the interim analysis, among 1486 randomly assigned patients (743 in the T-DM1 group and 743 in the trastuzumab group), invasive disease or death had occurred in 91 patients in the T-DM1 group (12.2%) and 165 patients in the trastuzumab group (22.2%). The estimated percentage of patients who were free of invasive disease at 3 years was 88.3% in the T-DM1 group and 77.0% in the trastuzumab group. Invasive disease–free survival was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.64; P<0.001). Distant recurrence as the first invasive-disease event occurred in 10.5% of patients in the T-DM1 group and 15.9% of those in the trastuzumab group. The safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of T-DM1, with more adverse events associated with T-DM1 than with trastuzumab alone. CONCLUSIONS 

Among patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who had residual invasive disease after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the risk of recurrence of invasive breast cancer or death was 50% lower with adjuvant T-DM1 than with trastuzumab alone.

The primary end point, invasive disease–free survival, was defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first occurrence of one of the following events (hereafter referred to as invasive-disease events): recurrence of ipsilateral invasive breast tumor, recurrence of ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer, contralateral invasive breast cancer, a distant disease recurrence, or death from any cause. The standardized definitions for efficacy end points (STEEP criteria) also include second primary nonbreast cancer as an invasive-disease event,16 so this larger definition of invasive-disease events plus second primary nonbreast cancer was used as a secondary end point. Other secondary end points included disease-free survival (including non­ invasive breast cancers), overall survival, distant recurrence–free survival, and safety. A sample of 1484 patients was planned on the basis of a requirement of 384 invasive-disease events to provide 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 with a two-sided significance level of 5% for the primary analysis. This calculation assumed that the percentages of patients who would be free of invasive disease at 3 years would be 70.0% with trastuzumab and 76.5% with T-DM1. A single interim analysis of invasive disease–free survival was planned when approximately 67% of the projected invasive-disease events had occurred, with a P value of 0.0124 for 

Statistical Analysis 

Imaging assessment for metastatic disease was not mandatory after patients received neoadjuvant therapy and underwent surgery before randomization. Patients were assessed for toxic effects before each dose of trial therapy was administered and during scheduled follow-up visits. The left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed during the last week of cycle 2; every four cycles thereafter; at trial-drug completion (if an assessment was not performed in the previous 6 weeks); at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months; and annually thereafter to year 5. Clinical assessments for disease recurrence occurred every 3 months from the date of randomization to year 2, then every 6 months to year 5, and annually thereafter to year 10.

cycles (16 weeks) of a conventional preoperative chemotherapy regimen containing a minimum of 9 weeks of taxane-based therapy and 9 weeks of trastuzumab therapy (slightly shorter treatment durations were permitted for dose-dense regimens). Anthracyclines and alkylating agents were permitted according to local standards, as were additional HER2-targeted agents. (Additional eligibility criteria are provided in the Supplementary Methods section of the Supplementary Appendix.) Exclusion criteria included the following: gross residual disease remaining after mastectomy or positive margins after breast-conserving surgery; progressive disease during neoadjuvant therapy; and cardiopulmonary dysfunction, including heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II (mild symptoms and function limitation) or higher or a history of a reduction in the left ventricular ejection fraction to less than 40% with previous therapy. Randomization and Treatment 

Within 12 weeks after surgery, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio with the use of an interactive voice-response or Web-response system. A permuted-block randomization scheme was used with stratification according to the following: clinical stage at presentation (inoperable breast cancer [tumor stage T4 or nodal stage N2 or N3 and metastasis stage M0] vs. operable breast cancer [tumor stage T1 to T3, nodal stage N0 or N1, and metastasis stage M0]); hormone-receptor status according to local laboratory assessment (estrogen-receptor–positive, progesterone-receptor–positive, or both vs. estrogen-receptor–negative and progesterone-receptor– negative or unknown); preoperative HER2-directed therapy (trastuzumab alone vs. trastuzumab plus an additional HER2-directed agent); and pathological nodal status evaluated after neoadjuvant therapy (node-positive vs. node-negative or not evaluated). Patients received T-DM1 at a dose of 3.6 mg per kilogram of body weight or trastuzumab at a dose of 6 mg per kilogram intravenously every 3 weeks for 14 cycles. A loading dose of 8 mg of trastuzumab per kilogram was administered if more than 6 weeks had elapsed since the preceding dose of trastuzumab. Patients who discontinued T-DM1 early because of toxic effects could complete 14 cycles of trial treatment with trastuzumab at the discretion of the investigator.

Invasive disease–free survival (Panel A) was defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first occurrence of one of the following: recurrence of ipsilateral invasive breast tumor, recurrence of ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer, contralateral invasive breast cancer, a distant disease recurrence, or death from any cause. Distant recurrence (Panel B) was defined as evidence of breast cancer in any anatomical site — other than ipsilateral invasive breast tumor or recurrence of locoregional invasive breast cancer — that was either histologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed as recurrent invasive breast cancer. No statistical adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. For overall survival (Panel C), the P value for the boundary for significance in this prespecified interim analysis was less than 0.000032, corresponding to a hazard ratio of less than 0.43.

of the patients had adverse events of grade 3 or higher in the T-DM1 group, as compared with 15.4% in the trastuzumab group. Peripheral sensory neuropathy of any grade was reported in 138 patients who received T-DM1 (18.6%) and 50 patients who received trastuzumab (6.9%); 103 of the 138 cases of sensory neuropathy in the T-DM1 group (74.6%) were reported by the investigators as being resolved at the data cutoff point. Pneumonitis (of any grade) occurred in 19 patients in the T-DM1 group (2.6%) and 6 patients in the trastuzumab group (0.8%). Of the adverse events of any grade, 11 (1.5%) and 5 (0.7%), respectively, were radiation pneumonitis; all cases were resolved at the data cutoff point. Increased aminotransferase levels of any grade occurred more frequently in the T-DM1 group (elevated alanine aminotransferase level in 23.1% of the patients and elevated aspartate aminotransferase level in 28.4%) than in the trastuzu­ mab group (elevated alanine aminotransferase level in 5.7% of the patients and elevated aspartate aminotransferase level in 5.6%) (Table 3). Two adjudicated cases of hepatic nodular regenerative hyperplasia occurred in the T-DM1 group. Adjudicated cardiac events occurred in 4 patients in the trastuzumab group (0.6%) and in 1 patient in the T-DM1 group (0.1%). 

Discussion In this trial, adjuvant treatment with T-DM1 resulted in a 50% lower risk of recurrence of invasive disease or death than adjuvant continuation of trastuzumab among patients with HER2positive early breast cancer and residual invasive disease after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy. As expected, a higher percentage of patients had adverse events in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group; adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 25.7% of patients in the T-DM1 group and in 15.4% of those in the trastuzumab group. Subgroup analyses showed a consistent benefit, irrespective of hormone-receptor status, the extent of residual disease at surgery, single or dual HER2-targeted therapy in the neoadjuvant regimen, and baseline characteristics of the patients. Distant recurrence was the first invasive-disease event in fewer patients in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group (10.5% vs. 15.9%). Additional follow-up will be necessary to determine

elevated aspartate aminotransferase level [in 1.6%], and elevated alanine aminotransferase level [in 1.5%]), peripheral sensory neuropathy (in 1.5%), and decreased ejection fraction (in 1.2%). One patient in the T-DM1 group who had a decreased platelet count died from an intracranial hemorrhage that occurred after a fall (Table 2). The percentages of patients with hemorrhage of grade 3 or higher were similar in the T-DM1 group and the trastuzumab group (0.4% and 0.3%). Adverse events of any grade were more common in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzu­ mab group (98.8% vs. 93.3%) (Table 3, and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix), and 25.7%

Patients may have had more than one adverse event. †	One patient with a platelet count of 55,000 per cubic millimeter fell at home and died of an intracranial hemorrhage. ‡	The most common adverse event leading to discontinuation of the trial drug in the trastuzumab group was a decreased ejection fraction in 10 of 720 patients (1.4%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial drug in the T-DM1 group were a decreased platelet count in 31 of 740 patients (4.2%), an increased blood bilirubin level in 19 patients (2.6%), an increased aspartate aminotransferase level in 12 patients (1.6%), an increased alanine aminotransferase level in 11 patients (1.5%), peripheral sen­ sory neuropathy in 11 patients (1.5%), and a decreased ejection fraction in 9 patients (1.2%).

among these studies. For example, patients in the KATHERINE trial had a substantially worse baseline prognosis than those enrolled in the ExteNET and APHINITY trials. The safety profile of T-DM1 was consistent with that in previous studies; as expected, there were more adverse events with T-DM1 than with adjuvant trastuzumab. Higher-grade or enduring adverse events are of particular importance in the treatment of early breast cancer. All the patients in our trial had received neoadjuvant therapy with a taxane, and patients with preexisting grade 1 neuropathy were allowed to enroll in the trial. Peripheral sensory neuropathy of any grade was reported in 138 patients in the T-DM1 group (18.6%) and in 50 patients in the trastuzumab group (6.9%), and grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in 10 patients in the T-DM1 group (1.4%). By the time of data cutoff, neuropathy had resolved in 103 of 138 patients in the T-DM1 group (74.6%). Despite a higher percentage of patients with thrombocytopenia in the T-DM1 group, the percentages of patients with hemorrhage of grade 3 or higher were similar in the two groups (0.4% in the T-DM1 group and 0.3% in the trastuzumab group). However, 1 patient in the T-DM1 group died of an intracranial hemorrhage associated with a fall and grade 2 thrombocytopenia. Two cases of hepatic nodular regenerative hyperplasia occurred in the T-DM1 group. Radiation pneumonitis occurred in 11 patients in the T-DM1 group (1.5%); this incidence was higher than that in the control group (0.7%). There were fewer cardiac events in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group, although there were only five events (0.3%) overall. A potential limitation of the KATHERINE trial was the pragmatic decision to preferentially use the pretreatment core biopsy specimen of the primary tumor to centrally confirm positive HER2-status. The apparent loss of HER2-positive status in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy has been reported,19,20 but our trial was not designed to specifically address the activity of T-DM1 in this subgroup. Further analyses to define the rate of HER2 loss in the postsurgical specimens and the activity of T-DM1 in these patients are planned and possible, since paired specimens from more than two thirds of the patients in the trial have been obtained. In conclusion, in this randomized, phase 3 trial, among patients with HER2-positive early

whether there is an effect of adjuvant T-DM1 on overall survival. Patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who have residual invasive disease after standard neoadjuvant therapies, which include tras­ tuzumab, have a substantially less favorable prognosis than those with a pathological complete response.3-5 However, pathological complete responses occur in only 40% to 60% of patients,1,3-5 and a paucity of published data exist to provide guidance on postoperative therapy in patients in whom residual disease is detected in the resected breast specimen or lymph nodes. Since standard adjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer is 1 year of HER2-targeted therapy, completion of this therapy in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy has become an accepted practice, irrespective of pathological response status. In the KATHERINE trial, switching from HER2-directed therapy to single-agent T-DM1 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with tras­ tuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy (either single or dual HER2 blockade) improved outcomes in patients with persisting invasive cancer at surgery. It is notable, however, that even with the improved outcomes seen with T-DM1 in these patients, the central nervous system was one of the sites of first recurrence in approximately 5% of patients in both treatment groups (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Recurrence in the central nervous system in patients with HER2positive early breast cancer remains a persistent problem for which effective therapies are lacking. Our trial is the third global, phase 3 trial to show greater improvement in outcomes with additional HER2-targeted therapy than with 1 year of trastuzumab alone in patients with HER2positive, early breast cancer. The ExteNET trial evaluated 1 year of extended adjuvant therapy with neratinib monotherapy as compared with placebo after completion of 1 year of trastuzu­ mab.17 In the APHINITY trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive either pertuzumab or placebo added to standard adjuvant chemotherapy plus 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab for resected, operable, HER2-positive breast cancer.18 The KATHERINE trial focused on higherrisk patients with residual invasive breast cancer after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administered with trastuzumab-containing therapy. Differences in trial designs and patient populations limit the usefulness of comparisons n engl j med﻿﻿ nejm.org﻿
