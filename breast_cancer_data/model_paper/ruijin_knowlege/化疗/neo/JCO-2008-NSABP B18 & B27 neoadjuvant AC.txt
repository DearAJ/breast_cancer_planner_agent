Purpose National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) Protocol B-18 was designed to determine whether four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) administered preoperatively improved breast cancer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with AC administered postoperatively. Protocol B-27 was designed to determine the effect of adding docetaxel (T) to preoperative AC on tumor response rates, DFS, and OS. Patients and Methods Analyses were limited to eligible patients. In B-18, 751 patients were assigned to receive preoperative AC, and 742 patients were assigned to receive postoperative AC. In B-27, 784 patients were assigned to receive preoperative AC followed by surgery, 783 patients were assigned to AC followed by T and surgery, and 777 patients were assigned to AC followed by surgery and then T. Results Results from B-18 show no statistically significant differences in DFS and OS between the two groups. However, there were trends in favor of preoperative chemotherapy for DFS and OS in women less than 50 years old (hazard ratio [HR] ⫽ 0.85, P ⫽ .09 for DFS; HR ⫽ 0.81, P ⫽ .06 for OS). DFS conditional on being event free for 5 years also demonstrated a strong trend in favor of the preoperative group (HR ⫽ 0.81, P ⫽ .053). Protocol B-27 results demonstrated that the addition of T to AC did not significantly impact DFS or OS. Preoperative T added to AC significantly increased the proportion of patients having pathologic complete responses (pCRs) compared with preoperative AC alone (26% v 13%, respectively; P ⬍ .0001). In both studies, patients who achieved a pCR continue to have significantly superior DFS and OS outcomes compared with patients who did not. Conclusion B-18 and B-27 demonstrate that preoperative therapy is equivalent to adjuvant therapy. B-27 also showed that the addition of preoperative taxanes to AC improves response.

INTRODUCTION 

Preoperative therapy, initially used only for locally advanced breast cancer, has become more common for patients with operable disease.1-17 This allows more individuals to undergo breast-conserving procedures and provides for observation of response to treatment. Long-term outcome significantly correlates with both clinical and pathologic tumor response rates.9,14,17-19 We provide here an update of extended outcomes for two preoperative chemotherapy trials of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), Protocols B-18 and B-27. The primary aim of Protocol B-18 was to determine whether preoperative chemotherapy with 

doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) would result in improved overall survival (OS) and diseasefree survival (DFS) compared with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Secondary aims were to evaluate the response of the primary breast tumor and involved lymph nodes to preoperative chemotherapy, to correlate the response with outcomes, and to determine whether preoperative chemotherapy increased use of breast-conserving surgery and decreased rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. We previously reported results through 9 years of follow-up.13-15 There were no significant differences in DFS and OS between groups. We now update results through 16 years of follow-up.

Preoperative Chemotherapy: NSABP Trials B-18 and B-27 

The primary objective of Protocol B-27 was to determine whether adding docetaxel (T) to preoperative AC would increase DFS and OS in patients with operable breast cancer. Clinical and pathologic responses in the breast and axillary nodal downstaging were assessed. We previously reported results through 6.5 years of followup16,17 and now update results through 8.5 years of follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligibility and Entry Procedures Protocol B-18 opened in October 1988 and closed in April 1993. Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Of the 1,523 patients, 763 were randomly assigned to the preoperative chemotherapy group, and 760 were assigned to the postoperative chemotherapy group. Details of enrollment, eligibility, and stratification variables have been described previously.13-15 Eligible patients for B-18 had operable, palpable breast cancer (T1-3, N0-1, M0) diagnosed by core needle biopsy or fine-needle aspirate (FNA). NSABP Protocol B-27 was opened to accrual in December 1995 and closed in December 2000 after 2,411 patients had been randomly assigned. Patient characteristics for B-27 are listed in Table 1. Women who had primary operable breast cancer (T1c-3, N0-1, M0 or T1-3, N1, M0) diagnosed by core biopsy or FNA were eligible. The stratification variables for both studies were age, clinical tumor size, and clinical nodal status. Because FNA results could be used to establish eligibility, hormone receptor status was not available at random assignment 

for these patients, so it was not used as a stratification variable. Both protocols had to be approved by the local human investigations committee or institutional review board, with assurances filed with and approved by the US Department of Health and Human Services. Patients were required to give written consent to enter the studies. Treatment In Protocol B-18, patients were randomly assigned to either surgery (lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection or modified radical mastectomy) followed by four cycles of AC chemotherapy (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2) every 21 days or the same chemotherapy followed by surgery. Before random assignment, surgeons were required to disclose the intended surgical procedure (lumpectomy or mastectomy) without considering possible downstaging by chemotherapy. Patients ⱖ 50 years of age received tamoxifen 10 mg orally twice a day for 5 years, starting after chemotherapy, regardless of hormone receptor status, whereas women less than 50 years of age did not receive hormonal therapy. Patients undergoing lumpectomy received whole-breast irradiation. Details of treatment have been described previously.13-15 In Protocol B-27, all patients were assigned to receive four cycles of AC every 21 days before surgery. Patients in groups 1 and 3 did not receive further preoperative chemotherapy, whereas patients in group 2 were assigned to receive four cycles of T preoperatively at 100 mg/m2 every 21 days. After the completion of AC in groups 1 and 3 or AC followed by T in group 2, patients underwent surgery (either lumpectomy plus axillary node dissection or modified radical mastectomy). Patients in group 3 received four cycles of postoperative T (100 mg/m2). In all study patients, tamoxifen (20 mg/d for 5 years)

was to be initiated on the first day of chemotherapy regardless of age or hormone receptor status. Patients undergoing lumpectomy were to receive a course of radiotherapy to the breast. Regional radiotherapy or radiotherapy to the chest wall after mastectomy was prohibited. Details of treatment have been described previously.16,17 

regional, or distant recurrences; clinically inoperable disease; gross residual disease after surgery; all second cancers and contralateral breast cancers; and all deaths. Events for the calculation of RFI included the first occurrences of local, regional, and distant breast cancer recurrences; clinically inoperable disease; and gross residual disease after surgery, whereas occurrences of contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancers, and deaths without evidence of recurrence were treated as censoring events. 

Tumor Response Before each chemotherapy treatment and before surgery, the two greatest perpendicular diameters of the tumors in the breast and axillary nodes were measured, and the products of these diameters were added as a measure of total tumor size. No clinical evidence of palpable tumor in the breast and axillary lymph nodes was defined as a clinical complete response (cCR). Reduction of the sum of the products of the tumor masses by 50% or greater was classified as a clinical partial response. An increase in the sum of the products of more than 50% or appearance of new suspicious ipsilateral axillary adenopathy was considered progressive disease. Tumors that did not meet the criteria for response or progression were classified as stable disease. Surgical specimens with no invasive cancer in the breast were considered to be a pathologic complete response (pCR). 

Statistical Methodology Simple log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models20 were used to make formal inferences about group comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier curves21 were used to quantify the values of OS, DFS, and RFI over time. In the Cox regression analyses, adjustments were made for age, clinical nodal status, and clinical tumor size according to the stratification schemes used in each protocol. The postoperative AC group in B-18 and the preoperative AC group in B-27 were used as the control (baseline) groups for the calculation of hazard ratios (HRs) in all of the treatment group comparisons. Analyses were also performed to determine whether significant treatment by stratification variable interactions existed with respect to the end points.22 Site-specific failure rates were calculated by using cumulative incidence curves.23 Cause-specific HRs for the site-specific end points in each study were obtained by adjusting for the stratification variables in that study.24 P values for treatment comparisons of cumulative incidence curves were obtained by using the method proposed by Fine and Gray.25,26 In the forest plots displaying comparisons of 

Other End Points The primary end points for these analyses across protocols were OS, DFS, and relapse-free interval (RFI). For each type of event, the time to the first occurrence of that event was analyzed. Analyses of OS included all deaths

subsets defined by stratification variables, HRs reflect unadjusted treatment comparisons. Analyses of end point data are based on information received at the NSABP Biostatistical Center as of December 31, 2006, at which time, 625 deaths, 844 DFS events, and 582 RFI events had been reported in eligible B-18 patients and 563 deaths, 882 DFS events, and 701 RFI events had been reported in eligible B-27 patients. The median times on study for eligible patients with follow-up information on B-18 and B-27 were 16.0 and 8.5 years, respectively. 

free for 5 years demonstrated a trend for benefit in favor of the preoperative group (HR ⫽ 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.00; P ⫽ .053; Fig 2). In Protocol B-27, 304, 292, and 286 events were reported in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There continue to be no statistically significant differences according to treatment for DFS (group 2 v group 1: HR ⫽ 0.92; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.08; P ⫽ .29; group 3 v group 1: HR ⫽ 0.92; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.08; P ⫽ .29; Fig 1E). The 5- and 8-year DFS estimates were 68% and 59% in group 1, 71% and 62% in group 2, and 70% and 62% in group 3, respectively. 

RESULTS 

RFI Patient Characteristics Baseline patient characteristics within each protocol are listed in Table 1. B-18 patients, compared with B-27 patients, were slightly older at entry (50.0 v 48.4 years, respectively; P ⬍ .001), had smaller tumors (average clinical tumor size, 3.5 v 4.5 cm, respectively; P ⬍ .001), and had a significantly lower frequency of clinically positive nodes (26% v 30%, respectively; P ⫽ .02). B-18 also had a larger proportion of white women than B-27 (P ⬍ .001). 

There was no significant difference in RFI between the two treatment groups in B-18 (HR ⫽ 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.15; P ⫽ .78; Fig 1C). In B-27, both groups assigned to receive T seemed to do better than the group treated with AC alone (group 2 v group 1: HR ⫽ 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99; P ⫽ .04; group 3 v group 1: HR ⫽ 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.04; P ⫽ .14; Fig 1F). The 5- and 8-year RFI estimates were 71% and 66% in group 1, 76% and 71% in group 2, and 74% and 69% in group 3, respectively. 

Response In the preoperative AC group of Protocol B-18, an objective clinical response occurred in 79% of the assessable patients, with a clinical partial response in 43% and a cCR in 36%. A pCR was documented in 13% of patients. Preoperative chemotherapy patients had a significantly increased incidence of pathologically negative axillary nodes compared with patients randomly assigned to postoperative chemotherapy (58% v 42%, respectively; P ⬍ .0001). Moreover, 68% of individuals in the preoperative group had breast-conserving surgery compared with 60% of individuals in the postoperative chemotherapy group (P ⫽ .001). In Protocol B-27, 86% of the patients in the two groups assigned to receive preoperative AC only (groups 1 and 3) achieved a clinical response compared with 91% of patients in the preoperative AC and T group (P ⬍ .001). The cCR rate was increased from 40% to 63% with the addition of four cycles of T (P ⬍ .001). The pCR rate was increased from 13% in groups 1 and 3 to 26% in group 2 (P ⬍ .001). 

First Reported Sites of Treatment Failure There continue to be no statistically significant differences in the rates of treatment failure at any specific site in B-18 (Table 2). There was a trend toward a higher rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence with preoperative chemotherapy versus postoperative chemotherapy (13% of 506 patients v 10% of 450 patients, respectively); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P ⫽ .21). The cumulative incidences of all local recurrences as well as distant recurrences were not significantly different between the two groups (P ⫽ .08 and P ⫽ .22, respectively). In B-27, there continued to be a significant decrease in the cumulative incidence of all local recurrences as first events in patients assigned to receive T (groups 2 and 3) compared with patients who did not receive T (group 1; HR ⫽ 0.67; P ⫽ .02). However, there were no other significant differences in the cumulative incidence of recurrences at any other sites of first failure (Table 3). 

DFS In Protocol B-18, there have been 434 events in the postoperative group and 410 events in the preoperative group, with no significant difference in DFS between the two groups (HR ⫽ 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.06; P ⫽ .27; Fig 1B). The 5-, 8-, and 16-year DFS estimates were 67%, 55%, and 39% in the postoperative group and 67%, 58%, and 42% in the preoperative group, respectively. DFS conditional on being event

Survival In Protocol B-18, there continue to be no statistically significant differences in survival between the two groups (HR ⫽ 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.16; P ⫽ .90; Fig 1A). The 5-, 8-, and 16-year survival estimates were 81%, 72%, and 55%, respectively, in the postoperative group and 80%, 72%, and 55%, respectively, in the preoperative group.

Treatment-by-Covariate Interactions and Subset Analyses In Protocol B-18, there was a significant treatment-age interaction for OS (P ⫽ .01) and nearly significant treatmentby-age interactions for DFS and RFI (P ⫽ .14 and P ⫽ .06, respectively). Specifically, there was a trend in favor of preoperative chemotherapy compared with postoperative therapy for OS and DFS in women younger than 50 years old (OS: HR ⫽ 0.81, P ⫽ .06; DFS: HR ⫽ 0.85, P ⫽ .09). At 16 years of follow-up, in women less than 50 years old, OS was 55% in the postoperative chemotherapy group compared with 61% in the preoperative chemotherapy group, and DFS was 38% v 44%, respectively. Conversely, in women ⱖ 50 years at entry, there was a trend in favor of postoperative chemotherapy for OS (HR ⫽ 1.23, P ⫽ .07). At 16 years of follow-up, the OS in the 

postoperative and preoperative chemotherapy groups was 55% and 50%, respectively. DFS was not statistically different between treatment groups for women more than 50 years of age at entry (HR ⫽ 1.03, P ⫽ .76). No other significant treatment-bycovariate interactions were found in B-18 (Fig 3). In Protocol B-27, no significant heterogeneity of treatment effect was detected across age categories or the other stratification variables. Association Between Pathologic Response and Outcome In B-18, individuals who achieved a pCR continue to have superior DFS and OS outcomes compared with patients who did not achieve a pCR (DFS HR ⫽ 0.47, P ⬍ .0001; OS HR ⫽ 0.32, P ⬍ .0001; Fig 4A).

Although there were no significant differences in OS or DFS overall in Protocol B-18, women less than 50 years of age seemed to benefit from preoperative versus postoperative chemotherapy. In contrast, women ⱖ 50 years old had better outcomes with postoperative chemotherapy. These results were initially presented at 9 years on study15 and persist after a median of 16 years on study. The overview analyses from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group27 indicate that the effects of chemotherapy are most apparent in younger women. It is possible that the benefit of preoperative chemotherapy relative to postoperative chemotherapy could be age dependent as well. In addition, younger women are more likely to have estrogen 783

receptor (ER) –negative tumors,28 and International Breast Cancer Study Group data suggest there may be a preferential benefit to early initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal women with ER-negative tumors.29 Tumors that are ER negative also tend to have a higher pathologic response rate to chemotherapy than ER-positive tumors.16,30-32 In the adjuvant setting, data suggest that the absolute benefits from chemotherapy are greater with ER-negative tumors compared with ER-positive tumors.33 Additionally, analyses from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group demonstrated that chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy and anthracycline versus nonanthracycline chemotherapy had greater absolute benefit in the ER-negative and ER-poor subsets.34 These explanations are speculative but may explain why younger women seemed to have a greater benefit from preoperative chemotherapy. Because of the limitations on the availability of hormone receptors from the B-18 study, data are not available to address this issue. Conversely, the delay in surgery and hormonal therapy resulting from preoperative chemotherapy might have been detrimental in older women with ER-positive tumors. This might be particularly problematic for strongly ER-positive tumors withlowrecurrencescoresandalowlikelihoodofrespondingtochemotherapy.35 It is also noteworthy that, in Protocol B-18, DFS conditional on being event free for 5 years demonstrated a nearly statistically significant benefit in favor of the preoperative chemotherapy group. This post hoc analysis revealing the separation of the DFS curves at approximately 5 years could be a reflection of an effect on ER-positive tumors, which have a greater risk for late recurrences, with 60% of the recurrences occurring after year 5. In contrast, ER-negative tumors have a higher risk of recurrence within the first 5 years.36 Moreover, such an effect might also have contributed to the treatment-by-age interaction discussed earlier, with preoperative chemotherapy being preferentially beneficial at preventing late recurrences of ER-positive tumors in younger women, who did not receive any hormonal therapy in B-18. Whether this would have been a strictly cytotoxic effect or perhaps a benefit from earlier ovarian suppression in the preoperative group less than 50 years old is also a matter of conjecture. Thus, the combination of late and age-related benefit of preoperative chemotherapy may result from the benefit of earlier chemotherapy in younger patients with ER-negative tumors and a decrease in late recurrences of ERpositive tumors in women who did not receive tamoxifen. Furthermore, as noted earlier, delaying surgery while giving ineffective chemotherapy may have been detrimental in older women. Women participating in B-27 were slightly younger at study entry, had larger tumors, and had a higher proportion of clinically positive nodes than did women in B-18. Despite these adverse characteristics, an analysis adjusted for baseline characteristics indicated that women in B-27 had significantly better outcomes on average than women in B-18. This may reflect other improvements in patient treatment, including the addition of taxane, the use of tamoxifen in premenopausal patients, and more effective hormonal therapy options. These long-term data from NSABP B-18 and B-27 continue to demonstrate that the achievement of pCR in the breast and negative axillary nodes after preoperative therapy clearly predict favorable long-term outcomes. However, most patients will not achieve a pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, significant heterogeneity exists in terms of outcomes among non-pCR patients after preoperative therapy. For example, in NSABP B-27, among women who did 784 

not achieve a pCR, the 8-year DFS was 70% for patients with negative nodes compared with 40% for patients with four to nine positive nodes. Conversely, some patients with chemotherapy-nonresponsive tumors may nevertheless do well, perhaps because their tumors are slow growing or because of effective hormonal therapy.35 It is imperative that efforts continue, to develop molecular markers of response to predict patients who will achieve a pCR and patients who will have a favorable prognosis despite not achieving a pCR. Published data demonstrate that gene expression profiles can be predictors of a pCR in the neoadjuvant setting.35 Gene expression profiles from B-27 are being evaluated for prediction of outcomes in patients who did not achieve a pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (S. Paik, personal communication, March 2007). This may help to identify those non-pCR patients who might benefit from new therapies and those who will do well despite a non-pCR. Furthermore, other methods have been proposed to quantitate the residual tumor burden and to predict patient outcomes after neoadjuvant therapy.37,38 Development and validation of predictive markers for outcomes of patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy will be critical for achieving optimal benefit from these therapies. Overall, preoperative chemotherapy is equivalent to adjuvant chemotherapy with respect to OS and DFS; however, it may be beneficial for patients who desire breast conservation but are not good candidates at presentation. Moreover, despite the weakness of pCR as a surrogate for OS and DFS in the detection of a treatment effect, preoperative chemotherapy may be valuable for addressing research questions about breast cancer biology and response to treatment.
