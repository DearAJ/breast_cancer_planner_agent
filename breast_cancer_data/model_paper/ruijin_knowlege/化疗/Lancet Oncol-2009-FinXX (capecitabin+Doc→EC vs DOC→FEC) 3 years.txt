Summary Background Standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for patients with moderate-to-high-risk early breast cancer typically contain a taxane, an anthracycline, and cyclophosphamide. We aimed to investigate whether integration of capecitabine into such a regimen enhances outcome. Methods In this open-label trial, we randomly assigned (centrally by computer; stratiﬁed by node status, HER2 status, and centre) 1500 women with axillary node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer to either three cycles of capecitabine and docetaxel followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and capecitabine (capecitabine group, n=753), or to three cycles of docetaxel followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and ﬂuorouracil (control group, n=747). The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival. A planned interim analysis was done after 3 years’ median follow-up. Eﬃcacy analyses were by modiﬁed intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00114816. Findings Two patients in each group were excluded from eﬃcacy analyses because of withdrawal of consent or distant metastases. After a median follow-up of 35 months (IQR 25∙5–43∙6), recurrence-free survival at 3 years was better with the capecitabine regimen than with control (93% vs 89%; hazard ratio 0∙66, 95% CI 0∙47–0∙94; p=0∙020). The capecitabine regimen was associated with more cases of grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea (46/740 [6%] vs 25/741 [3%]) and hand-foot syndrome (83/741 [11%] vs 2/741 [<1%]) and the control regimen with more occurrences of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (368/375 [98%] vs 325/378 [86%]) and febrile neutropenia (65/741 [9%] vs 33/742 [4%]). More patients discontinued planned treatment in the capecitabine group than in the control group (178/744 [24%] vs 23/741 [3%]). Four patients in the capecitabine group and two in the control group died from potentially treatment-related causes. Interpretation The capecitabine-containing chemotherapy regimen reduced breast cancer recurrence compared with a control schedule of standard agents. Capecitabine administration was frequently discontinued because of adverse eﬀects. Funding Roche, Sanoﬁ-Aventis, AstraZeneca, Cancer Society of Finland. 

Introduction Adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of an alkylating agent, an anthracycline, and a taxane is typically administered for early breast cancer, although the regimens used can vary considerably.1–3 Results from a few large randomised trials and a meta-analysis suggest that addition of a taxane to adjuvant regimens containing an anthracycline improves disease-free and overall survival.4–6 Despite such advances in chemotherapy, many women diagnosed with early breast cancer still eventually succumb to the disease. Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of ﬂuorouracil, which has been used in the treatment of advanced breast cancer for a few decades. After absorption, it is metabolised in the liver and in cancerous tissue. The ﬁnal step of conversion to ﬂuorouracil is catalysed by thymidine phosphorylase, which is present in high amounts in breast tumours.7 www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 10 December 2009 

Administration of docetaxel, paclitaxel, or cyclophosphamide boosts the concentration in tumour tissue of thymidine phosphorylase in xenograft models, suggesting that these agents might act in a synergistic manner with capecitabine.8–10 In women treated with docetaxel, or doxorubicin or epirubicin given with cyclophosphamide before surgery for breast cancer, thymidine phosphorylase was greatly stimulated in both tumour and stromal cells.11 Women with advanced breast cancer treated with an anthracycline had augmented survival when randomised to receive docetaxel plus capecitabine compared with those assigned to docetaxel alone.12 Since thymidine phosphorylase production in cancer tissue is important for capecitabine activity, in the current study (the Finland capecitabine trial [FinXX]), we administered capecitabine with agents that might enhance activity of this enzyme in tumours.

Methods Patients 

For the trial protocol see http://ctep.cancer.gov 

We undertook a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial in 15 Finnish hospitals and ﬁve Swedish hospitals. We deemed women eligible for the study if they had histologically conﬁrmed invasive breast cancer at medium-to-high risk of recurrence, deﬁned as either: regional node-positive disease (isolated tumour-cell clusters <0∙2 mm in diameter were not judged a metastasis); or node-negative disease with primary tumour diameter greater than 20 mm and negative progesterone receptor assay (usually classiﬁed as staining of <10% of cancer cells).13,14 Other eligibility criteria included: age 18–65 years; WHO performance score 0 or 1 (on a scale of 0–5, with a score of 5 indicating death); interval of 12 weeks or fewer between surgery and randomisation; and normal renal, cardiac, and hepatic function (serum alanine aminotransferase ≤1∙5× upper limit of normal; alkaline phosphatase ≤2∙5× upper limit of normal; bilirubin ≤1∙0× upper limit of normal). Main exclusion criteria were: presence of distant metastases; node-negative mucinous, papillary, medullary, or tubular disease; clinically signiﬁcant cardiac disease; and previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The trial protocol was approved by independent ethics committees and by the medical authorities. All patients provided written informed consent. Study safety was monitored by an independent data safety monitoring committee.

Randomisation and masking We randomly assigned patients (centrally and with computer-assisted masking), in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either a capecitabine-containing chemotherapy regimen (capecitabine group) or a control schedule. A physicist otherwise uninvolved in the study generated the randomisation code (M Tenhunen, Department of Oncology, Helsinki University Central Hospital). We did randomisation with permutated blocks: block size (two, four, or six) varied at random. We stratiﬁed women at random allocation according to the number of axillary lymph nodes that contained cancer (≤3 vs >3), HER2 status (negative vs positive; ascertained by either immunohistochemistry or in-situ hybridisation), and centre. A trained study nurse communicated the randomisation result to study sites by fax. 

Procedures Patients allocated to the capecitabine group received capecitabine (900 mg/m² twice a day, days 1–15) plus docetaxel (60 mg/m² as a 1-h intravenous infusion on day 1 of every 3-week cycle), followed by cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m² on day 1), epirubicin (75 mg/m² on day 1), and capecitabine (900 mg/m² twice a day, days 1–15, every 3 weeks). Those assigned control received docetaxel (80 mg/m² as a 1-h intravenous infusion on day 1 of every 3-week cycle) followed by cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m²), epirubicin (75 mg/m²), and ﬂuorouracil (600 mg/m²), all administered on day 1 of every 3-week cycle. In the capecitabine group, the ﬁrst capecitabine dose of every cycle was given in the evening of day 1 and the last dose was administered on the morning of day 15, followed by a 7-day rest period. We gave patients oral corticosteroids at standard doses at the time of docetaxel infusions. We permitted haemopoietic growth factor support for symptomatic neutropenia but did not allow prophylactic use. We administered treatment for six cycles (three cycles of each regimen) in both groups, unless individuals had disease recurrence or intolerable toxic eﬀects. Patients received locoregional radiotherapy according to the institution’s practice after completion of chemotherapy. Those with steroid hormone receptor-positive disease received adjuvant endocrine therapy for 5 years. We gave tamoxifen (20 mg/day) to individuals deemed premenopausal before the start of chemotherapy, whereas postmenopausal women received anastrozole (1 mg/day). Hormonal therapy was initiated within 2 months of completion of chemotherapy. We implemented a dose-modiﬁcation scheme in the event of grade 2–4 non-haematological toxic eﬀects (graded according to the National Cancer Institute’s common terminology criteria for adverse events, version 3.0). If a patient had a grade 2 event, we interrupted treatment and resumed it at the same dose once the toxic eﬀect had resolved. If they developed a second grade 2 event, or their ﬁrst grade 3 event, we www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 10 December 2009

stopped chemotherapy and, after resolution to grade 0–1, resumed it at 80% of the starting dose. If a third grade 2 event arose, we continued treatment at 60% of the starting dose. For a fourth grade 2 event, the regimen was discontinued. If an individual had a second grade 3 event or any grade 4 toxic eﬀect, we usually stopped treatment. If the investigator attributed an adverse event to one drug, then only that agent was dose-reduced. We decreased the doses of all drugs by 20% for febrile neutropenia or grade 3–4 neutropenia with infection. When scheduled treatment was discontinued for toxic eﬀects, we replaced agents as follows: capecitabine and docetaxel by cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and capecitabine, or cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and ﬂuorouracil; single-agent docetaxel by cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and ﬂuorouracil; and cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and capecitabine by cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and ﬂuorouracil, or cyclophosphamide and epirubicin. We regarded staging examinations (chest CT or radiography; bone scan; and abdominal CT, MRI, or ultrasound) as mandatory at screening for patients with four or more positive axillary nodes,15,16 but these procedures were undertaken at the discretion of the investigator for all other patients. We did laboratory tests (blood-cell count and serum chemistry) within the 3 days preceding the planned start of every chemotherapy cycle. We recorded all events arising during study treatment or within 28 days of the last dose of chemotherapy. We scheduled follow-up of study participants for a minimum of 5 years after randomisation. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival, deﬁned as the time between randomisation and date of diagnosis of invasive breast cancer recurrence, or death if the patient died before cancer recurrence. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, deﬁned as the time from randomisation to death, and treatment safety. 

Statistical analysis We estimated the recruitment period to be 3·5 years. We amended the protocol on Nov 23, 2007, to include an interim analysis to assess treatment safety and early eﬃcacy. We expected that recurrence-free survival would rise from 83·0% to 88·5% (hazard ratio 0·65) after median follow-up of 5 years. Based on this assumption, a total of 205 events and 1500 patients were needed to achieve 80% power, assuming a 3% annual dropout rate, when α=0·028 (two-sided). To maintain a signiﬁcance level of 5%, we set the signiﬁcance level in interim and ﬁnal analyses at 0·028.17 The interim analysis had 80% power to detect an improvement from 89·0% to 93·5% (HR 0·58) after median follow-up of 3 years in 1500 patients (α=0·028, two-sided testing) and when about 120 recurrences had happened. We calculated sample sizes with nQuery Advisor version 6.0. We did eﬃcacy analyses by modiﬁed intention to treat.

We analysed frequency tables with Fisher’s exact test or the χ² test, and we compared age and weight distributions with the t test. To compare survival between groups, we used the Kaplan-Meier life-table method and an unadjusted Cox proportional-hazards model; we implemented the log-rank test to conﬁrm the robustness of the analysis. We undertook subgroup analyses by inclusion in the Cox model of treatment group, the subgroup variable, and their interaction. All p values are two-sided and not adjusted for multiple testing. We did statistical analyses with SAS version 8.2 for Windows. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00114816. 

Between Jan 27, 2004, and May 29, 2007, 1500 patients were recruited from 15 Finnish centres (n=1199) and ﬁve Swedish centres (n=301). Four women were excluded from the modiﬁed intention-to-treat population (two withdrew informed consent before they received study treatments, two had overt distant metastases at the time of study entry; ﬁgure 1). Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups (table 1). 90% of patients had node-positive cancer, and 19% had HER2-positive disease. The study protocol was amended in May, 2005, to allow administration of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive disease. Subsequently, 96 (13%) of 753 patients assigned to the capecitabine group and 83 (11%) of 747 allocated control were given trastuzumab. Respectively, 56 (7%) and 50 (7%) women received single-agent trastuzumab after discontinuation of chemotherapy for up to 12 months, 24 (3%) and 21 (3%) received trastuzumab concomitantly with docetaxel only, and 16 (2%) and 12 (2%) received trastuzumab concomitantly with docetaxel plus single-agent trastuzumab for up to 12 months after chemotherapy. Adjuvant endocrine therapy was given to 592 (79%) and 575 (77%) patients after completion of chemotherapy in the capecitabine and the control groups, respectively. Tamoxifen, anastrozole, and other hormonal treatments were administered, respectively, to 325 (43%), 316 (42%), and 29 (4%) patients assigned to the capecitabine group, and to 287 (38%), 328 (44%), and 27 (4%) women allocated to the control group. At the time of data lock (Aug 31, 2008), median follow-up was 35 months (IQR 25·5–43·6). 134 events (deaths, distant or local relapses) had happened, 54 (7%) in the capecitabine group and 80 (11%) in the control group, which triggered the interim analysis.

containing regimen (0·66, 95% CI 0·47–0·94; p=0·020; table 2; ﬁgure 2). In the capecitabine group, three women developed invasive contralateral breast cancer and six had other cancers, compared with two and eight patients, respectively, in the control group. The proportions of women developing these cancers were similar (1·2% vs 1·3%, respectively). Disease-free survival (which includes invasive contralateral breast cancers and second cancers) was longer in the capecitabine group than in the control group (0·68, 0·49–0·94; p=0·020). When patients treated with trastuzumab were excluded from the main analysis, the hazard ratio for recurrence-free survival still favoured the capecitabine-containing regimen (0·64, 0·44–0·91; p=0·014). In exploratory subgroup analyses, recurrence-free survival was better in the capecitabine group than in the control group, with the exception of patients with HER2-positive disease (ﬁgure 3). In this analysis, the interaction between treatment and HER2 status was signiﬁcant (p=0·0049), whereas interactions between treatment and the other subgroups shown in ﬁgure 3 were not (p>0·10). The safety proﬁles of the two regimens diﬀered. Patients who received capecitabine had more occurrences of grade 3 or 4 hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea, nail changes, and stomatitis than did those in the control group, whereas neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infection with neutropenia, amenorrhoea, and myalgia were more frequent in the control group (table 3). Four patients in the capecitabine group died during chemotherapy from possibly treatment-related causes (septic colitis; suicide; myocardial infarction; unknown cause [suspected cardiac arrhythmia]) and two died in the control group (pulmonary arterial embolism; septicaemia). All six planned cycles of chemotherapy were administered to 566 (75%) individuals assigned the capecitabine-containing regimen compared with 718 (96%) allocated control.

treatment was most frequent in the capecitabine group (178 [24%] vs 23 [3%] assigned control; p<0·0001). Of those allocated to the capecitabine group, 98 (13%) discontinued during docetaxel and capecitabine cycles and a further 80 (11%) during cyclophosphamide, 1149

epirubicin, and capecitabine cycles. In the control group, 16 (2%) individuals discontinued during docetaxel monotherapy and seven (1%) stopped during cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and ﬂuorouracil. Adverse events were the most usual reason for treatment discontinuation in both groups. 58 (8%) and 139 (19%) patients assigned to the capecitabine and control groups, respectively, had the docetaxel dose reduced because of toxic eﬀects. 319 (43%) women took less than the scheduled starting dose of capecitabine on one or more occasions owing to toxic eﬀects or for other reasons. Including replaced cycles, most patients (1461 [98%]) received a total of six cycles. 

Discussion Our ﬁndings showed enhanced recurrence-free survival for patients who received a regimen containing capecitabine in addition to docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide compared with women who received docetaxel, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and ﬂuorouracil. Overall survival data from FinXX are not yet mature, but we noted the hazard ratio for overall survival was similar to that for recurrence-free survival. Single-agent capecitabine has been compared with combination chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of elderly patients with breast cancer,18 but to our knowledge, FinXX is the ﬁrst adjuvant trial to report eﬃcacy of capecitabine in combination with other agents for treatment of early breast cancer. Our results suggest that integration of capecitabine upfront with potentially synergistic chemotherapeutic agents and into several cycles might be an eﬀective treatment strategy. This hypothesis is supported by data of randomised studies undertaken in the neoadjuvant setting.19,20 Inclusion of capecitabine in the taxane and anthracycline-containing parts of the regimen distinguishes FinXX from other trials investigating incorporation of capecitabine into adjuvant regimens. Findings of a randomised trial in the neoadjuvant setting indicated a 20% pathological complete response rate with cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and capecitabine compared with 13% in patients receiving ﬂuorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide.21 The enhanced eﬃcacy we recorded in the capecitabine arm was gained at the cost of increased diarrhoea and hand-foot syndrome, although febrile neutropenia was less frequent than with the control regimen, which is probably attributable to the reduced docetaxel dose. Two women in the capecitabine group died from cardiac causes possibly related to study treatment. Cardiotoxicity is a known eﬀect of the ﬂuoropyrimidine class of chemotherapeutic agents, and individuals receiving ﬂuoropyrimidines need to be monitored for symptoms and signs of these cardiac eﬀects, although cardiotoxicity might be less typical with capecitabine than with infused ﬂuorouracil.22 In our study, most patients who interrupted capecitabine administration could continue treatment with other study agents and complete six cycles of chemotherapy. 1150 

The control arm in our study represents a regimen frequently used in Finland and Sweden, which is not dissimilar to the types of regimen administered in many other countries.8,23,24 Docetaxel 80 mg/m² is a lower dose than the 100 mg/m2 regarded as standard in some regions. We selected the dose of 80 mg/m² for two reasons: (1) on the basis of toxic eﬀects recorded with docetaxel 100 mg/m² in the FinHer trial, leading to protocol modiﬁcation;25 and (2) because no diﬀerence in time-to-progression or survival was recorded between starting doses of 75 mg/m² and 100 mg/m² in the intention-to-treat population of a randomised trial of docetaxel as second-line therapy for advanced breast cancer.26 Adjuvant docetaxel administered at either 80 mg/m² or 100 mg/m² at 3-week intervals before three cycles of ﬂuorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide for early breast cancer might show similar survival.27 The docetaxel dose of 60 mg/m² administered in the capecitabine group is fairly low, but this amount was eﬀective in combination with other agents and rarely needed to be reduced. Our results suggest that eﬃcacy is maintained when capecitabine is given at a dose of 900 mg/m² instead of 1250 mg/m² twice a day in combination with docetaxel,12 and these data are consistent with analyses of capecitabine dose-reduction in metastatic disease.28 The hypothesis that an even lower capecitabine dose could be appropriate is being tested in an ongoing US Oncology Group trial, in which capecitabine is given at a dose of 825 mg/m² concomitantly with docetaxel. Retrospective analysis of one study suggests that docetaxel plus capecitabine might be more eﬀective than docetaxel alone for treatment of oestrogen receptorpositive advanced breast cancer in particular, but this idea needs conﬁrmation.29 Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea is unlikely to account for the high eﬃciency of capecitabine combinations, because persistent amenorrhoea was less frequent in women allocated to the capecitabine group compared with those assigned control. In conclusion, risk of breast-cancer recurrence was reduced by incorporation of capecitabine into a regimen containing a taxane and anthracycline. The eﬀect was substantial and could be comparable to or greater than that achieved with the introduction of taxanes to adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer.6,30 However, this possibility needs to be conﬁrmed in ongoing trials of adjuvant capecitabine. Integration of capecitabine was associated with frequent discontinuation of planned chemotherapy, but most patients could tolerate all six scheduled cycles. Studies that focus on further reﬁnement of the current chemotherapy regimen are warranted. Contributors HJ, P-LK-L, AJ-V, MT, PA, PB, and HL had the idea for and designed the study.
