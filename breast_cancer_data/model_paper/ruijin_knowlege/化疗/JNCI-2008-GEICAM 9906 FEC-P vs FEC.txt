Taxanes are among the most active drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and, as a consequence, they have also been studied in the adjuvant setting. 

Methods 

After breast cancer surgery, women with lymph node–positive disease were randomly assigned to treatment with fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) or with FEC followed by weekly paclitaxel (FEC-P). The primary endpoint of study—5-year disease-free survival (DFS)—was assessed by Kaplan– Meier analysis. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and analysis of the prognostic and predictive value of clinical and molecular (hormone receptors by immunohistochemistry and HER2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization) markers. Associations and interactions were assessed with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for DFS for the following covariates: age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node status, type of chemotherapy, tumor size, positive lymph nodes, HER2 status, and hormone receptor status. All statistical tests were two-sided. 

Results 

Among the 1246 eligible patients, estimated rates of DFS at 5 years were 78.5% in the FEC-P arm and 72.1% in the FEC arm (difference = 6.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6% to 11.2%; P = .006). FEC-P treatment was associated with a 23% reduction in the risk of relapse compared with FEC treatment (146 relapses in the 614 patients in the FEC-P arm vs 193 relapses in the 632 patients in the FEC arm, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.62 to 0.95; P = .022) and a 22% reduction in the risk of death (73 and 95 deaths, respectively, HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.06; P = .110). Among the 928 patients for whom tumor samples were centrally analyzed, type of chemotherapy (FEC vs FEC-P) (P = .017), number of involved axillary lymph nodes (P < .001), tumor size (P = .020), hormone receptor status (P = .004), and HER2 status (P = .006) were all associated with DFS. We found no statistically significant interaction between HER2 status and paclitaxel treatment or between hormone receptor status and paclitaxel treatment. 

Conclusions 

Among patients with operable breast cancer, FEC-P treatment statistically significantly reduced the risk of relapse compared with FEC as adjuvant therapy. J Natl Cancer Inst 2008;100:805–814

Background 

CONTEXT AND CAVEATS Prior knowledge Taxanes are among the most active drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Study design Phase 3 randomized trial among women with lymph node–positive disease evaluating treatment with fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) with FEC followed by weekly paclitaxel (FEC-P). Contribution FEC-P treatment statistically significantly reduced the risk of relapse compared with FEC as adjuvant therapy. FEC-P treatment was associated with a statistically significant 23% reduction in the risk of relapse compared with FEC treatment and a non–statistically significant 22% reduction in the risk of death. 

Limitations The number of patients evaluated in this trial was small.

A comprehensive meta-analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (1,2) has demonstrated that chemotherapy (mainly cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil [CMF]–like regimens) administered after surgery is able to reduce the annual odds of recurrence and death among operable breast cancer patients by 24% and 14%, respectively. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, anthracycline-containing combination treatments were tested as adjuvant therapy in prospective randomized trials and appeared to be statistically significantly more effective in preventing breast cancer relapse and death than CMF chemotherapy (1). The absolute benefit in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) obtained with anthracyclines (doxorubicin or epirubicin) compared with CMF is, however, small (3% at 5 years and 4% at 10 years) (2), and the long-term toxic effects of these drugs, particularly their cardiac toxic effects (3), are important concerns and indicate that anthracycline-containing regimens should be used only for women who are most likely 806 Articles | JNCI 

Patients and Methods Study Population Women eligible for the study were aged between 18 and 75 years and had undergone primary curative surgery (ie, mastectomy, tumorectomy, or lumpectomy) with axillary lymph node dissection (in which at least six lymph nodes were isolated) for operable unilateral carcinoma of the breast (stage T1–T3). After providing written informed consent, all patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group within 8 weeks after surgery. All patients had at least one axillary lymph node that was positive for cancer on histological examination. The margins of resected specimens had to be histologically free of invasive carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. A complete staging workup was carried out within 16 weeks before registration in the study. The workup included bilateral mammography, chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasonography or computed tomography, bone scan, and assessment of the left ventricular ejection fraction by use of multiple gated acquisition scanning or echocardiography. All patients were examined to ensure adequate bone marrow as well as liver and renal function (the required determinations were as follows: absolute neutrophil count of >1.2 × 109 cells per liter, platelet count of >100 000 × 109 Vol. 100, Issue 11 | June 4, 2008

Implications In the adjuvant setting, addition of taxanes to FEC chemotherapy reduces the risk of relapse for patients with lymph node–positive breast cancer. 

to benefit from them. It has been proposed that the subset of patients who actually benefit from treatment with anthracyclines (as opposed to CMF) are those whose tumors have amplification of the topoisomerase II␣ gene (4) or HER2 gene (5). Taxanes are among the most active drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Several adjuvant therapy trials (6–10) comparing anthracycline-containing chemotherapy with taxane (paclitaxel and docetaxel)-containing regimens (ie, the ﬁrstgeneration taxane trials) showed an absolute improvement in 5-year DFS of 4%–7%. Because taxane-containing regimens are usually even more toxic than the conventional anthracyclinecontaining regimens and because the beneﬁt is limited to a small percentage of patients, the identiﬁcation of the subgroup of patients who actually beneﬁt from taxane-containing regimens is crucial. Several attempts (6–8) have been made, largely on the basis of retrospective subset analyses, to identify the molecular characteristics of the breast tumors from the patients who obtain the greatest beneﬁt from taxane treatment. To date, hormone receptor (ie, estrogen and progesterone receptor) and HER2 status are two of the most important molecular factors that are prognostic and could be predictive of response to chemotherapy in early breast cancer (11). A recent study by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) has indicated that patients who obtain the maximum beneﬁt from paclitaxel are those whose tumors overexpress the HER2 gene (12). We previously reported (13) the preliminary interim analysis of a ﬁrst-generation taxane trial, the Grupo Español para la Investigación del Cáncer de Mama (GEICAM [Spanish Group for the Investigation of Breast Cancer]) trial 9906, which evaluated ﬂuorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) alone vs the taxane-containing combination of FEC followed by weekly paclitaxel (FEC-P). We now present the ﬁnal results of this study. We also investigate associations between various molecular characteristics and response to taxane treatment. 

Study Design Eligible patients were stratified according to institution, menopausal status, and number of involved axillary lymph nodes (one to three vs four or more) and randomly assigned to the control or experimental arm by means of a computer program. Treatment in the control arm consisted of six 21-day cycles of FEC (5-fluorouracil at 600 mg/m2 body surface area, intravenous epirubicin at 90 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide at 600 mg/m2, which was administered intravenously). All drugs were administered on day 1. Treatment in the experimental (FEC-P) arm consisted of four 21-day cycles of the same FEC schedule and, after 3 weeks of no treatment, eight 1-week courses of paclitaxel at 100 mg/m2 via a 60-minute intravenous infusion. The primary endpoint was 5-year DFS, which was deﬁned as the time from randomization to the date of a clinical relapse (with histopathologic conﬁrmation or radiological evidence of tumor recurrence), a second cancer (with the exception of skin cancer other than melanoma, ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix), or death, whichever occurred ﬁrst. The trial deﬁnition of DFS was coincident with the deﬁnition of invasive disease–free survival in the Standardized Deﬁnitions for Efﬁcacy and End Points in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trials (STEEP) System (14). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (deﬁned as the time from randomization until death from any cause) and analysis of the prognostic and predictive value of the molecular markers hormonal receptor status and HER2/neu status, and safety. Although it was not prospectively planned as part of the original protocol, an analysis of distant relapse–free survival (deﬁned as the time from randomization to the date of a distant breast cancer relapse or death from any cause) was also performed. The trial deﬁnition of distant relapse–free survival was coincident with the deﬁnition in the STEEP System. Concomitant Therapy and Dose Modifications All patients receiving FEC had appropriate prophylactic antiemetic treatment that included corticoids and serotonin antagonists. Before paclitaxel administration, patients received dexamethasone (10 mg), ranitidine (50 mg), and diphenhydramine (50 mg). The jnci.oxfordjournals.org 

study protocol did not permit primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. However, the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was mandatory among patients who had at least one episode of febrile neutropenia or an infection in subsequent cycles. Dose modifications were planned according to standard toxicity criteria. For patients with clinically relevant grade 3 toxic effects, the dose of all drugs was reduced by 25%. Treatment was to be discontinued in patients who had nonhematologic grade 4 toxic effects (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) or who had clinically significant adverse cardiac events. On completion of chemotherapy, tamoxifen (20 mg daily for 5 years) was mandatory for all patients whose tumors were positive (according to the institution’s guidelines) for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or both. In September 2005, an amendment allowing the administration of aromatase inhibitors to menopausal women was introduced to the study protocol. Radiotherapy was mandatory after breast-conserving surgery and was administered after mastectomy according to the guidelines of each participating institution, mostly to women with tumors of more than 5 cm or with four or more affected lymph nodes. Clinical and Laboratory Evaluations Blood counts and general biochemical and clinical assessments, including those for toxic effects, were performed on day 21 of each cycle during FEC treatment and on day 8 of every paclitaxel course. This procedure was continued every 3 months for the first 2 years of follow-up and every 6 months for the following 3 years, after which the assessments were performed annually. Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 1.0. Follow-up visits were scheduled every 3 months in years 1 and 2 after chemotherapy, every 6 months in years 3–5, and yearly thereafter. Hematologic and biochemical determinations were performed at each visit. Chest radiography was repeated every 6 months for the first 5 years of follow-up, and mammography was repeated annually during follow-up. Parafﬁn-embedded tumor samples, which were taken at the time of surgery, were processed centrally in the Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Laboratory at the Centro de Investigación del Cáncer (CIC)-Salamanca. Tumor tissue was analyzed in tissue microarrays containing three cores from each tumor sample, with each core being 0.6 mm in diameter. The hormone receptor status of tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis for progesterone receptor (with anti–progesterone receptor antibodies, clone PgR636, dilution 1:50, product M3569, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and estrogen receptor (anti–estrogen receptor antibodies, clone 1D5, dilution 1:35, product M7047, DAKO) by the use of the DAB Map system (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Staining was scored according to the Allred method (15), which scores the number of immunoreactive cells (as 0–5) and the staining intensity (as 0–3) by use of a semiquantitative scale; the Allred score is the sum of both results. Allred scores of less than 3 were considered negative. Tumors were considered hormone receptor positive if they were either estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor positive. HER2 gene ampliﬁcation was evaluated by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (with the HER2 FISH pharmDx kit, product K5331, JNCI | Articles 807

platelets per liter, hemoglobin level of >10 g/dL, total bilirubin level of ≤1× the upper limit of normality [ULN] according to each institution’s guidelines, alkaline phosphatase of ≤2.5× ULN, aspartate transaminase of ≤1.5× ULN, and serum creatinine of ≤1× ULN or measured or calculated creatinine clearance of >60 mL/min). Criteria for exclusion were advanced disease (ie, stage T4, N2 or N3, or M1), a history of other cancers, motor or sensory neuropathy of grade 2 or more (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria), pregnancy, lactation, or any serious illness or medical condition other than breast cancer. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating hospitals and by the Spanish Government Health Authorities. The trial was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and International Conference on Harmonization rules, including on-site veriﬁcation of all relevant source data by GEICAM monitors. The study was registered at www. clinicaltrials.gov (identiﬁer code = NCT00129922). The participating investigators are listed in the Appendix. 

DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), with a positive result being deﬁned as a HER2 gene to chromosome 17 ratio of more than 2. HER2 protein overexpression was evaluated with the DAKO HercepTest kit (product K5207, DAKO, Glostrup) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Scoring criteria for this technique include the intensity and pattern of membrane staining (ie, the whole membrane, partial staining) (16). Scoring values ranged between 0 and 3. A score of 3 was considered as a positive test. Results were independently evaluated by two pathologists at the CICSalamanca. Final score for each tumor sample was the mean score from three cores corresponding to each specimen. When a core was missing, the ﬁnal score was assumed to correspond to the mean of all the scores available for evaluation. The maximum discrepancy in Allred scores allowed between both observers was two points, and the value used in the statistical analyses was the mean score from both individuals. No discrepancies were allowed in HER2 status results; both observers were obliged to reach a consensus. Statistical Analyses The primary endpoint was DFS at 5 years. When the trial was designed, the 5-year DFS was estimated as 60% for the control arm. A sample size of 1250 patients (625 in each arm) was calculated as being necessary to detect an expected 8% absolute difference in favor of the FEC-P arm. The hypothesis tests were two-sided, and the values for ␣ and ␤ accepted as being statistically significantly were .05 and .2, respectively. Survival variables (ie, relapse and death) were analyzed by use of the Kaplan–Meier method (17). Log-rank test was used to compare time-to-event data between both treatment arms. The Cox proportional hazards model was 808 Articles | JNCI 

Results Patients and Patient Characteristics From November 1, 1999, through June 30, 2002, a total of 1289 women from 65 GEICAM institutions were considered potential subjects for the trial (Figure 1). The patient selection criteria were scored on a specially designed questionnaire that was sent by fax to the GEICAM staff. The staff used the questionnaires to determine eligibility for each patient; 41 patients were found to be ineligible. The remaining 1248 eligible patients were assigned to treatment with six cycles of FEC only or to treatment with four cycles of FEC followed by 8 weeks of paclitaxel treatment (FECP). Two patients who were initially considered eligible and randomly assigned to treatment in the trial were later found to have metastatic disease via computed tomography scans performed after registration and were censored from the trial. Therefore, 1246 patients were eligible and randomly assigned to the FEC arm (n = 632) or to the FEC-P arm (n = 614). The efficacy analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle in eligible patients (n = 1246), regardless of treatment compliance. Tumor samples were available for 928 of these patients; data on hormone receptor status were available for 923 and on HER2 status were available for 926. Vol. 100, Issue 11 | June 4, 2008

used to evaluate the effect on 5-year DFS of age (≤50 vs >50), menopausal status (premenopausal vs postmenopausal), tumor size (≤2.5 vs >2.5 cm), lymph node status (one to three vs four or more), and hormone receptor status according to each institution determination (positive vs negative) (intention-to-treat population). The same variables, plus the interaction of HER2 status and paclitaxel and of hormone receptor status and paclitaxel, were included in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model analysis applied to the subset of patients whose tumor samples were centrally analyzed for HER2 and hormone receptor status. The interaction effect was defined as the ratio of hazard ratios (HRs) for recurrence in HER2positive vs HER2-negative tumors and in hormone receptor– positive (ie, positive for estrogen and/or progesterone receptors) vs –negative (ie, negative for both estrogen and progesterone receptors) tumors. We verified that the data conformed to the assumptions for using the Cox model by a visual method with the risk function logarithm and by evaluating the log-lineal relation assumption with the Martingale residuals. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate probability estimates for DFS and overall survival. The primary analysis was conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, and a stratified log-rank test was used to compare patients in the FEC-P arm with those in the FEC arm with respect to both DFS and overall survival rates. The analysis of prognostic and predictive value for hormone receptor status and HER2 status was defined in the protocol, but no attempt was made to provide power calculations for subgroup analyses. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from the Cox proportional hazards models. The trial data were collected and maintained by the GEICAM. All analyses were conducted according to protocol. Source verification of all relevant data was performed by GEICAM monitors. The manuscript was drafted by two of the authors (M. Martín and Á. Rodríguez-Lescure) and modified following review by all coauthors.

The characteristics of eligible patients and their tumors are shown in Table 1. In general, the two treatment arms were well balanced in terms of demographic and tumor characteristics, except for hormone receptor status; patients in the FEC-P arm had a higher percentage of hormone receptor–positive tumors than those in the control FEC arm (79.1% vs 84.1%, difference = 5%, 95% CI = 1.7% to 9.3%; P = .024). This imbalance, however, was not observed among the 923 patients for whom a central review of hormone receptor status was available. Treatment Three patients in the FEC arm and one in the FEC-P arm did not receive adjuvant therapy for the following reasons: patient refusal (one patient), loss to follow-up after randomization (one patient), and intercurrent disease (two patients). Consequently, 1242 jnci.oxfordjournals.org 

(99.7%) of the 1296 patients started treatment as specified in the protocol (629 in the FEC arm and 613 in FEC-P arm) and were included in the safety analysis. Fourteen patients in the FEC arm received fewer than the planned six cycles of therapy. An additional patient who had been assigned to the FEC arm withdrew consent and received only four cycles of FEC followed by 8 weeks of paclitaxel. Nineteen (3%) of the 614 patients assigned to the FEC-P arm did not receive the weekly paclitaxel treatment (nine patients who refused treatment, six who experienced a toxic effect during FEC treatment, and four whose treatment was stopped at the decision of the physician when they had received only four cycles of FEC). The median relative dose intensity of FEC was 99% in both arms. The median relative dose intensity of weekly paclitaxel in the 594 patients who received this drug was 99.5%.

after chemotherapy was administered to 445 (70.4%) of the 632 patients in the FEC arm and 435 (70.8%) of the 614 patients in the FEC-P arm. Hormonal adjuvant therapy was administered to 491 (77.7%) patients in the FEC arm and 504 (82.1%) patients in the FEC-P arm. Tamoxifen alone (for 5 years) was administered to 258 (40.8%) patients in the FEC arm and to 256 (41.7%) in the FEC-P arm. Tamoxifen followed by aromatase inhibitors (for 5 years in total) was administered to 218 (34.5%) patients in the FEC arm and 241 (39.3%) patients in the FEC-P arm. A few patients in each arm (15 in the FEC arm and 7 in the FEC-P arm) received aromatase inhibitors alone. Thirty-four patients with hormone receptor–positive tumors (2.7%) of the 1246 patients (17 in each arm) did not receive any hormonal therapy. Efficacy Overall, at a median follow-up of 66 months, 339 DFS events (ie, relapse, second malignancy, or death from any cause, whatever happen first) had been registered (193 of the 632 patients in the FEC arm and 146 of the 614 patients in the FEC-P arm) (Table 2). The estimated rates of DFS at 5 years (Figure 2, A) were 78.5% in the FEC-P arm and 72.1% in the FEC arm (difference = 6.4%, 95% CI = 1.6% to 11.2%; P = .006, stratified log-rank test). Disease-free survival was better in the FEC-P arm than in the FEC arm (unadjusted HR for relapse in the FEC-P arm compared with the FEC arm = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.92; P = .006). After adjustment for lymph node status, age, tumor size, histology, hormone receptor status, and hormonal therapy, FEC-P treatment was found to reduce the risk of relapse by 23% compared with FEC treatment (HR of relapse = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.62 to 0.95; P = .022). The difference in DFS between the two arms was due mainly to the greater number of distant breast cancer relapses in the FEC arm than in the FEC-P arm (5-year distant relapse–free survival = 83.8% in the FEC-P arm vs 78.1% in the FEC arm; difference = 5.7%, 95% CI = 1.4% to 10.1%; HR for distant relapse = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.90; P = .006). 810 Articles | JNCI 

Analysis of Subtypes Tumor samples were available from 928 (74.5%) of the 1246 eligible patients in the trial and were assessed for HER2 amplification and hormone receptor expression at the central laboratory. The demographic and prognostic features, as well as DFS and overall survival, of patients whose tumor samples were and were not centrally tested were similar to each other (data not shown). The HER2 gene was amplified, as assessed by FISH, in 20.3% of tumor samples. Hormone receptor expression was positive in 65.5% of samples (Allred score = 3–8). Both treatment arms had similar proportions of women with HER2-positive and hormone receptor– positive tumors. Cox regression analysis was performed for the 928 patients from whom tumor samples were available. The dependent variable in the analysis was DFS; the independent variables were age, type of chemotherapy (FEC vs FEC-P), number of involved axillary lymph nodes, tumor size, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, HER2–paclitaxel interaction, and hormone receptor– paclitaxel interaction. Five of these independent variables were associated with DFS: type of chemotherapy (P = .017), number of involved axillary lymph nodes (P < .001), tumor size (P = .020), hormone receptor status (P = .004), and HER2 status (P = .006). Age, HER2–paclitaxel interaction, and hormone receptor– paclitaxel interaction were not statistically signiﬁcantly associated with DFS. Figure 3 shows a Kaplan–Meier analysis for DFS, in which the FEC and FEC-P arms were segregated according to hormone receptor status and HER2 status. The results remained the same when estrogen receptor status instead of hormone receptor status was used and when the Herceptest score of 3 (instead of ampliﬁcation by FISH) was used as criterion for HER2 positivity (data not shown). Toxicity Side effects (grade 3 or 4, observed in >4% of patients) that were worse in the FEC arm than the FEC-P arm were neutropenia (25.5% vs 19.1%, respectively), febrile neutropenia (9.5% vs 5.1%), fatigue (2.4% vs 4.2%), nausea (5.9% vs 5.4%), vomiting (9.9% vs 7.3%), and stomatitis (4.9% vs 3.1%). No deaths from sepsis occurred in either arm. Amenorrhea (transient or irreversible) was reported in 58.0% of premenopausal patients in the FEC arm and 65.0% in the FEC-P arm. Grade 2 alopecia was reported in more than 90% of patients in both arms. Toxic effects observed in the FEC-P arm alone were peripheral sensory neuropathy (grade 2 = 22.2%, grade 3 = 3.7%) and arthralgia or myalgia (grade 2 = 20.6%, grade 3 = 2.8%). Peripheral neuropathy reverted in all patients after treatment concluded. Five deaths were reported by the investigators as possible toxic deaths (two from myocardial infarction during FEC treatment, one from pulmonary embolism Vol. 100, Issue 11 | June 4, 2008

There were 168 deaths recorded (73 in the FEC-P arm and 95 in the FEC arm). Women in the FEC-P arm had a 22% lower risk of death than those in the FEC arm (adjusted HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.06; P = .110). Estimated overall survival rates at 5 years (Figure 2, C) were 89.9% in the FEC-P arm and 87.1% in the FEC arm (difference = 2.8%, 95% CI = 0% to 6.4%; P = .109).

Discussion The GEICAM 9906 trial showed that lymph node–positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant therapy consisting of four cycles of FEC-P had statistically significantly better 5-year DFS than those treated with six cycles of FEC (78.5% vs 72.1%, jnci.oxfordjournals.org 

P = .006). This difference was due mainly to the greater number of distant breast cancer relapses in the FEC arm. At a median followup of 66 months, there was also better overall survival in the FEC-P arm, although the difference was not statistically significant (estimated overall survival rates at 5 years of 89.9% in the FEC-P arm and 87.1% in the FEC arm; P = .110.). Five-year distant relapse–free survival was statistically significantly better in the FEC-P arm than in the FEC arm (83.8% vs 78.1%; P = .005). Because distant relapse–free survival is usually associated with overall survival (8,9), a statistically significant benefit in overall survival may become evident with a more protracted follow-up. In fact, the small sample size of the GEICAM 9906 trial, its JNCI | Articles 811

main limitation, could explain the lack of a statistically significant difference in overall survival between arms after a median followup of 66 months. The beneﬁt obtained with the FEC-P compared with FEC (23% reduction in the risk of relapse and 22% reduction in the risk of death) in the GEICAM 9906 trial is of similar magnitude to that observed with other taxane-containing regimens (6–10), with the absolute 5-year DFS advantage in the taxane arms in these trials being in the range of 4%–7%. Because taxanes have clinically relevant side effects, identiﬁcation of the population who actually beneﬁt from these drugs is very important. 812 Articles | JNCI 

Several attempts have been made to identify the biologic characteristics of patients who beneﬁt most from taxanes (17,19,20), but those assessments were based on retrospective subset analyses that, in most cases, precluded deﬁnitive conclusions (19–21). Hormone receptor status, one of the most important characteristics in breast tumor biology, has been proposed (19) to be a strong factor modulating the patient’s response to adjuvant chemotherapy. A retrospective analysis (20) of CALGB adjuvant trials has indicated that the beneﬁt of paclitaxel is limited mainly to estrogen receptor–negative patients. This ﬁnding, however, has not been conﬁrmed in other taxane trials (21). Vol. 100, Issue 11 | June 4, 2008

(600 mg/m2). In the experimental FEC-P arm, weekly paclitaxel also administered at the maximum tolerated doses was selected to deliver the maximum dose intensity of the drug over a relatively short period of time. Finally, the differences in subset results between the GEICAM 9906 trial and the CALBG 9344/Intergroup 0148 trial could be due to the retrospective, and unplanned, nature of the analyses. Unfortunately, none of these ﬁrst-generation adjuvant taxane trials had been designed to determine the effectiveness of taxanes in subgroups of patients with different tumor biomarkers. Retrospective identiﬁcations (by means of multiple comparisons) of the subgroups of patients who would really beneﬁt from taxanes can lead to spurious treatment associations (false-positive results); on the other hand, the post hoc subdivision of data into subgroups reduces the study’s power to detect statistically signiﬁcant treatment differences (leading to possible false-negative results). Unfortunately, because the beneﬁt of taxanes has been established in the overall population of patients with early breast cancer, new prospective studies evaluating combination treatments with and without taxanes in patients with speciﬁc subtypes of breast cancer (ie, hormone receptor–positive disease) cannot be conducted because of ethical concerns of a no-taxane treatment arm. Hence, retrospective analyses are likely to be the only source of information on this subject. References 1. Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group.

Hayes et al. (12) recently reported their results of a retrospective analysis of the interaction of HER2, paclitaxel treatment, and outcome in patients from the CALBG 9344/Intergroup 0148 trial, which compared treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel. The study had a double randomization process, initially to three different doses of doxorubicin (60, 75, or 90 mg/m2) and then to paclitaxel vs no paclitaxel. The authors hypothesized that HER2 status might predict greater beneﬁt from higher doses of doxorubicin and from additional paclitaxel. Their results indicated, however, that there was no interaction between doxorubicin dose and HER2 status. Conversely, HER2 positivity, regardless of estrogen receptor status, was associated with a statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁt from paclitaxel treatment (HR for recurrence = 0.59, P = .01). The interaction between HER2 status and paclitaxel efﬁcacy observed in the CALGB 9344/Intergroup 0148 trial has not been conﬁrmed by the GEICAM 9906 trial. That is, we did not ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant interaction between treatment with paclitaxel and HER2 status as determined by FISH or between treatment with paclitaxel and hormone receptor status. The difference between the GEICAM 9906 trial and the CALGB trial could be due to several factors. Although the interaction of paclitaxel treatment and HER2 status that was observed in the CALGB 9344/Intergroup 0148 trial could be due to the activity of paclitaxel itself, the outcomes could be explained by other factors as well (eg, a more appropriate chemotherapy duration in the experimental arm or an insufﬁcient anthracycline treatment in the control arm). The design of the CALGB 9344/Intergroup 0148 trial contains two weaknesses. First, the duration of treatment was not equivalent for the paclitaxel and no-paclitaxel arms (four cycles in one and eight cycles in the other). Thus, the beneﬁt observed could have been due merely to a more protracted chemotherapy regimen rather than to a taxane-speciﬁc effect. Duration of adjuvant chemotherapy itself can be a determinant of outcome, as shown in a randomized trial by the French Adjuvant Study Group (22) that demonstrated that a regimen of six cycles of FEC with epirubicin at 50 mg/m2 was superior to a regimen of three cycles of FEC with epirubicin at 75 mg/m2 or FEC with epirubicin at 50 mg/m2. Second, the regimen in the control arm (ie, four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) could be a suboptimal adjuvant treatment regimen (23,24), particularly in patients whose tumors overexpress HER2 (5). In individual trials, CMF treatment and doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide treatment were equivalent in terms of DFS and overall survival (25), whereas FEC regimens (26,27) and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and ﬂuorouracil regimens (28) were superior to CMF. Because HER2-positive patients obtain the maximum beneﬁt with anthracyclines (5), the administration of an appropriate anthracycline regimen to this particular subset of patients appears to be of critical importance. The design of the GEICAM 9906 trial was intended to avoid some of the weaknesses of the CALBG 9344/Intergroup 0148 trial. The duration of chemotherapy was similar in both arms of GEICAM 9906. The control FEC arm had six cycles of chemotherapy with the standard dose of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) and an appropriate dose of epirubicin (90 mg/m2) and 5-ﬂuorouracil
