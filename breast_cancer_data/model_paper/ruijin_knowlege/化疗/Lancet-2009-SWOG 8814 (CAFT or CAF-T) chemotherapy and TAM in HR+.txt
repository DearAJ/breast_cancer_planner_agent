Summary Background Tamoxifen is standard adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. We assessed the beneﬁt of adding chemotherapy to adjuvant tamoxifen and whether tamoxifen should be given concurrently or after chemotherapy. Methods We undertook a phase 3, parallel, randomised trial (SWOG-8814, INT-0100) in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer to test two major objectives: whether the primary outcome, disease-free survival, was longer with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and ﬂuorouracil (CAF) given every 4 weeks for six cycles plus 5 years of daily tamoxifen than with tamoxifen alone; and whether disease-free survival was longer with CAF followed by tamoxifen (CAF-T) than with CAF plus concurrent tamoxifen (CAFT). Overall survival and toxicity were predeﬁned, important secondary outcomes for each objective. Patients in this open-label trial were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm in a 2:3:3 ratio (tamoxifen:CAF-T:CAFT) and analysis was by intention to treat of eligible patients. Groups were compared by stratiﬁed log-rank tests, followed by Cox regression analyses adjusted for signiﬁcant prognostic factors. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00929591. Findings Of 1558 randomised women, 1477 (95%) were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. After a maximum of 13 years of follow-up (median 8·94 years), 637 women had a disease-free survival event (tamoxifen, 179 events in 361 patients; CAF-T, 216 events in 566 patients; CAFT, 242 events in 550 patients). For the ﬁrst objective, therapy with the CAF plus tamoxifen groups combined (CAFT or CAF-T) was superior to tamoxifen alone for the primary endpoint of disease-free survival (adjusted Cox regression hazard ratio [HR] 0·76, 95% CI 0·64–0·91; p=0·002) but only marginally for the secondary endpoint of overall survival (HR 0·83, 0·68–1·01; p=0·057). For the second objective, the adjusted HRs favoured CAF-T over CAFT but did not reach signiﬁcance for disease-free survival (HR 0·84, 0·70–1·01; p=0·061) or overall survival (HR 0·90, 0·73–1·10; p=0·30). Neutropenia, stomatitis, thromboembolism, congestive heart failure, and leukaemia were more frequent in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups than in the tamoxifen-alone group. Interpretation Chemotherapy with CAF plus tamoxifen given sequentially is more eﬀective adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, node-positive breast cancer than is tamoxifen alone. However, it might be possible to identify some subgroups that do not beneﬁt from anthracycline-based chemotherapy despite positive nodes.

Introduction The most common presentation of breast cancer is an oestrogen-receptor-positive tumour in postmenopausal women, for whom tamoxifen is the gold standard against which other systemic adjuvant treatments are compared.1–4 The addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy is attractive in theory,5 but there is no consensus about such treatment in postmenopausal women with tamoxifen-responsive disease.3,4 Individual phase 3 trials that compared chemotherapy plus tamoxifen with tamoxifen alone did not show a signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt in older women.6–9 A recent meta-analysis of www.thelancet.com Vol 374 December 19/26, 2009 

all existing trials based on individual patient data showed that the addition of chemotherapy to tamoxifen is only marginally beneﬁcial in older women, by contrast with major survival improvements in premenopausal populations.10 Most individual trials in postmenopausal women tested the addition of regimens based on cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and ﬂuorouracil (CMF) to tamoxifen,3,4,6–8,10 but in some breast cancer study populations, CMF might be inferior to anthracyclinebased regimens.11–16 No clinical trials have shown, however, that anthracycline-based therapy adds to the

beneﬁt of tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive disease. Moreover, interference with drug-induced cytotoxicity was shown in vitro when tamoxifen was added to cancer cell lines concurrently with chemotherapy,17–20 yet concurrent tamoxifen and CMF has been common practice in clinical trials. Our two objectives were to establish whether chemotherapy, consisting of 6 months of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and ﬂuorouracil (CAF) plus 5 years of tamoxifen, was superior to tamoxifen alone; and to assess whether CAF followed by tamoxifen was better than CAF plus concurrent tamoxifen. The CAF regimen we used was the most dose-intense combination among the commonly used regimens when this trial was designed.11 This report presents long-term outcomes for both objectives. 

Methods Trial design Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)-8814, INT-0100 was a phase 3, parallel, three-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial. The trial was approved by the National Cancer Institute’s Central Institutional Review Board, which manages all cooperative group trials, and the local review board at each institution. All patients gave written informed consent in the presence of an independent witness after the trial was explained by the treating oncologist. Progress of the trial and adverse event rates were reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring committee every 6 months. 

Participants Postmenopausal women (deﬁned in the protocol by use of standard National Cancer Institute criteria across all intergroup trials) with pathological stage T1–3, N1–2 (1988 criteria;21 excluding clinical N2) inﬁltrating adenocarcinoma of the breast were eligible for enrolment. Tumours were oestrogen-receptor positive or progesterone-receptor positive, or both, by biochemical assay 1558 patients randomised (based on institution designation of eligibility)

(≥10 fmol/mg) or classiﬁed as positive by immunohistochemistry according to institutional standards, with all tests done locally. Liver enzymes, chest radiograph, contralateral mammogram, and bone scan had to show no evidence of cancer. Deﬁnitive local therapy was modiﬁed radical mastectomy or lumpectomy with microscopically negative margins and axillary dissection. Radiotherapy was mandatory if a lumpectomy was done and optional after mastectomy if the stage was T3, four or more positive nodes were present, or if there was extranodal extension. Left-ventricular ejection fraction had to be normal, if done. Adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function were required. 

Randomisation and masking Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:3:3 ratio to receive tamoxifen alone, CAF followed by tamoxifen (CAF-T), or CAF with concurrent tamoxifen (CAFT). Eligible patients were stratiﬁed by number of involved nodes (1–3 vs ≥4), progesterone-receptor status (positive vs negative), and interval from surgery (≤6 weeks vs >6 weeks). Patients were allocated to treatment by a central software program that randomised within the cross-classiﬁcation of the three stratifying variables with allocation probability to each treatment being determined by the sample size goals. After a centre had entered a patient’s stratiﬁcation variables, the computer generated, reported, and recorded the randomised assignment and patient identiﬁcation number. It was not possible to know the next assignment since it was generated in real-time at the next registration. Blocking was not used. Both patient and treating physician were unmasked to randomisation assignment in this open-label study. 

Interventions CAF was given every 4 weeks for six cycles: cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m² orally on days 1–14; doxorubicin 30 mg/m² and ﬂuorouracil 500 mg/m², both intravenously on days 1 and 8. The tamoxifen dose was 20 mg orally daily for 5 years. Dose reduction and toxicity reporting criteria were speciﬁed in the protocol. Standardised radiation treatment prescriptions were stipulated in the protocol. The radiation had to be completed before CAF or initiated after completion of CAF at the discretion of the physician. Radiation was begun on day 1 in the tamoxifen group. Patients were followed every 4 months for 5 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then yearly thereafter, even if patients withdrew early from treatment. Follow-up for late recurrence was terminated because of ﬁnancial constraints, but mortality information is still obtained where possible. 

Primary and secondary endpoints The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, deﬁned as the time from registration (randomisation) to breast cancer relapse (local or distant), new primary breast cancer, or death due to any cause, whichever came ﬁrst. www.thelancet.com Vol 374 December 19/26, 2009

Patients who did not have an event were censored at the last follow-up visit. Prespeciﬁed secondary outcomes included overall survival and adverse event rates. Overall survival was deﬁned as the time from registration until death due to any cause. Adverse events were graded according to the SWOG Toxicity Criteria included in the protocol.

The target sample size for each CAF plus tamoxifen group (530 patients per group) gave 89% power to detect a 33% increase in the hazard ratio (HR) for disease-free survival for CAFT versus CAF-T. The target sample size for the tamoxifen-alone group (350 patients) gave 90% power to detect a 25% reduction in the HR for diseasefree survival for the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups compared with tamoxifen alone. Although the protocol speciﬁed one-sided tests (with overall α=0·05), only two-sided p values are reported here. The ﬁrst interim analysis was to take place when the accrual was 75% complete (α=0·010); the second was scheduled for 18 months after completion (α=0·013). The ﬁnal analysis was planned at α=0·04 so that the combined level was α=0·05 over all analyses.22 The intention-to-treat analyses included all eligible patients, irrespective of the actual treatment subsequently received. Documentation of eligibility was assessed within a few months of randomisation and centrally reviewed before outcome information was available. Patients who did not meet eligibility criteria after ﬁnal review were excluded from the analysis. Two planned analyses compared tamoxifen alone with the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups (CAF-T plus CAFT), and CAF-T with CAFT. Secondary analyses that compared all three groups were added when interim results disclosed eﬀect of tamoxifen timing on beneﬁt from chemotherapy. We used Kaplan-Meier methods for estimation of survival times and stratiﬁed log-rank tests to test treatment eﬀects using the three stratifying variables from randomisation.23 Cox models were used to estimate HRs of treatment beneﬁt adjusted for signiﬁcant prognostic factors. All analyses were done with Stata version 10. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00929591.

tamoxifen alone with the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups met criteria for reporting the primary outcome.24 Additional follow-up was required for overall survival25 and the ﬁrst comparison of the two CAF plus tamoxifen groups.26 Deﬁnitive 10-year estimates of disease-free survival and overall survival for both major objectives are now available. The early analyses reported HRs as tamoxifen alone versus CAF plus tamoxifen,24–26 whereas in this analysis they are reported as CAF plus tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone to be consistent with current clinical trial publications. The study population consisted of 1558 randomised women, of whom 1477 (95%) were eligible, with 361 assigned to tamoxifen; 566 to CAF-T; and 550 to CAFT (ﬁgure 1). Reasons for ineligibility were wrong stage or incomplete staging. The ineligibility rate did not diﬀer by treatment assignment (p=0·22). 1460 (94%) patients received allocated treatment (ﬁgure 1). Patient and tumour characteristics were well balanced across the treatment groups (table 1). Analysis of treatment delivery showed that 166 (15%) of 1116 patients did not complete six cycles of CAF because of toxicity (n=115 [10%]), disease progression or death (n=7 [1%]), or other reasons (n=44 [4%]). Completion of treatment did not diﬀer between the two 2057

CAF plus tamoxifen groups. Mean doses delivered (as percentage of planned doses) for cycles 1–3 were cyclophosphamide 86·6%, doxorubicin 86·1%, and ﬂuorouracil 85·8%; for cycles 4–6 these proportions were 72·4%, 74·4%, and 71·8%, respectively. 81 (5%) of 1477 patients stopped tamoxifen early because of toxicity, 17 (1%) did not receive tamoxifen, and 112 (8%) discontinued tamoxifen early for reasons other than toxicity. The ﬁrst study objective, the comparison of tamoxifen alone with the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups, was analysed for the primary disease-free survival and secondary overall survival endpoints. After a maximum of 13 years of follow-up (median 8·94 years), there were 179 (50%) events in 361 patients in the tamoxifen-alone group (149 relapses, nine new primary breast cancers, 21 deaths from causes other than breast cancer) and 458 (41%) events in 1116 patients in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups (318 relapses, 27 new primary breast cancers, 113 deaths from causes other than breast cancer). Disease-free survival was signiﬁcantly longer in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups than in the 2058 

tamoxifen-alone group (stratiﬁed log-rank test p=0·002; ﬁgure 2A). 10-year disease-free survival estimates were 57% (95% CI 53–60) for the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups and 48% (42–53) for the tamoxifenalone group. Compared with the tamoxifen group, the HR for disease-free survival in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups was 0·76 (95% CI 0·64–0·91; p=0·002) by Cox regression, adjusted for the other signiﬁcant independent prognostic factors of nodal status, receptor status, tumour size, and black ethnic origin (table 2). Overall survival was signiﬁcantly longer in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups than in the tamoxifen-alone group (stratiﬁed log-rank test p=0·043; ﬁgure 2B). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves began to diverge after the fourth year and remained separate for the rest of the study. 10-year overall survival estimates were 65% (62–68) for the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups and 60% (54–65) for the tamoxifen-alone group. The adjusted HR for overall survival for the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups compared with the tamoxifenalone group was 0·83 (0·68–1·01; p=0·057; table 2). www.thelancet.com Vol 374 December 19/26, 2009

Exploratory, unplanned analyses showed that beneﬁt from the addition of CAF to tamoxifen for disease-free survival and overall survival was seen in most major subsets listed in table 1. The unadjusted HRs for diseasefree survival for these subgroups suggest that there might be variation in the eﬃcacy of chemotherapy, particularly with number of positive nodes and age (ﬁgure 3). Patients with four or more positive nodes derived more beneﬁt than did those with one to three positive nodes (test for interaction p=0·015, adjusted for prognostic factors) and patients less than 65 years might have had a greater degree of beneﬁt than did older patients (test for interaction p=0·13, adjusted for prognostic factors; table 2). Additional variation of the unadjusted HRs in ﬁgure 3 might be attributable to small numbers or factors associated with number of positive nodes, such as the type of surgical procedure used. The second study objective—the comparison of CAF-T with CAFT—was analysed for the primary disease-free survival and secondary overall survival endpoints. Event rates were lower than predicted and there was late separation of the CAF-T and CAFT survival curves for disease-free survival (ﬁgure 2C) and overall survival (ﬁgure 2D). Disease-free survival for CAF-T was marginally superior to CAFT (stratiﬁed log-rank test, p=0·055), with 10-year estimates of 60% and 53%, respectively. The adjusted HR for disease-free survival (table 2) was 0·84 (0·70–1·01; p=0·061) for CAF-T compared with CAFT. The diﬀerence in overall survival was not signiﬁcant (stratiﬁed log-rank test, p=0·27), with 10-year estimates of 68% and 62%, respectively, and adjusted HR (table 2) of 0·90 (0·73–1·10; p=0·30) for CAF-T compared with CAFT. Secondary three-way comparisons were undertaken for the primary and secondary endpoints, because the timing of tamoxifen treatment aﬀected the degree of beneﬁt from CAF. The three-sample stratiﬁed log-rank tests were signiﬁcant for disease-free survival (ﬁgure 4A; p=0·002), but did not quite reach signiﬁcance for overall survival (ﬁgure 4B; p=0·074). The adjusted HR for disease-free survival for CAF-T was 0·70 (0·57–0·85; p=0·0002) and the HR for CAFT was 0·83 (0·69–1·01; p=0·062) compared with tamoxifen alone (table 2). For overall survival, the adjusted HRs were 0·79 (0·63–0·98; p=0·032) and 0·87 (0·70–1·08; p=0·22) for CAF-T and CAFT, respectively, compared with tamoxifen alone. The absolute 10-year beneﬁts in disease-free survival for CAF-T and CAFT over tamoxifen were 12% and 5%, respectively (ﬁgure 4A). 513 women died during the study (tamoxifen, n=145; CAF plus tamoxifen, n=368). Deaths from causes other than acute treatment toxicity or breast cancer occurred in 147 (10%) patients (29% of deaths). 73 (22%) of 337 deaths in women aged less than 65 years at study entry were not caused by breast cancer or acute toxicity compared with 74 (42%) of 176 deaths in women aged 65 years or older. Speciﬁc ascertainment of the reason www.thelancet.com Vol 374 December 19/26, 2009 

for these deaths (competing or unrelated cause vs late toxicity) was not possible. Mortality and morbidity during year 1 of treatment for the tamoxifen alone and combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups are shown in table 3.

Grade 2–4 emesis or stomatitis was seen in 255 (23%) and 294 (27%) patients, respectively. There were 40 (3·6%) thrombotic events during CAF (mainly deep vein thromboses), ten (0·9%) reports of grade 3–4 congestive heart failure, and four patients had grade 1–2 decline of ejection fraction. No diﬀerences in toxicity were noted between treatment with CAF-T and CAFT. Table 3 also shows late treatment-related adverse events in 1430 patients who completed 1 year without early relapse. Congestive heart failure was reported in 25 patients (0·36 per 100 person-years) in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups and in one patient (0·048 per 100 person-years) in the tamoxifen-alone group.

embolism, deep venous thrombosis, or stroke occurred in 24 patients (0·34 per 100 person-years) assigned to CAF plus tamoxifen and in seven patients (0·33 per 100 personyears) assigned to tamoxifen alone. The rates of non-breast second primary malignancies in the tamoxifen-alone group were similar to those in the CAF plus tamoxifen groups, apart from secondary acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (tamoxifen, no events; CAF-T plus CAFT, nine events [0·14 per 100 person-years]). There were 19 uterine malignancies, (tamoxifen, 0·16 per 100 person-years; CAF-T plus CAFT, 0·19 per 100 personyears). Rates for all of these adverse events were similar in the CAFT and CAF-T groups (data not shown). 

Discussion We found that adjuvant treatment with a combination of CAF plus tamoxifen signiﬁcantly improved disease-free survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with node-positive, hormonereceptor-positive breast cancer. This advantage was greater in women with four or more positive nodes and in younger postmenopausal women (aged <65 years), although beneﬁt cannot be ruled out for women with one to three positive nodes or for older women.

who do not seem to beneﬁt, despite the overall trial ﬁnding that CAF plus tamoxifen is beneﬁcial compared with tamoxifen alone.27 The other primary objective of this study was to investigate whether potential antagonism between tamoxifen and chemotherapy (suggested by preclinical data17–20) was manifested by a worse clinical outcome for concomitant therapy than with sequential treatment. The magnitude of beneﬁt for disease-free survival when CAF was added to tamoxifen seemed greater when this drug followed chemotherapy than when it was given concurrently. Two small trials prospectively addressed timing of tamoxifen administration in relation to chemotherapy, but neither reported a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in outcome between concurrent and sequential treatment.28,29 There are several reasons why concurrent tamoxifen could interfere with chemotherapy,17–20 but none of them has been conclusively proven. Overall survival was an important secondary outcome in this population of postmenopausal women. Whereas overall survival showed the same general trend as disease-free survival, the HRs were attenuated and signiﬁcance was not reached. This study supports the use of disease-free survival as a primary outcome because of reduced follow-up time, but also shows that reaching signiﬁcance for overall survival might require longer follow-up in patients with endocrine-responsive breast cancer. Our data support the use of anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen in clinical practice. On the basis of our results, the recent St Gallen consensus recommended that tamoxifen should be started after chemotherapy,4 and this approach is current policy for major cooperative group adjuvant studies. However, the concerns about concomitant tamoxifen with chemotherapy that were raised by this study should not be extrapolated to aromatase inhibitors, the other major form of endocrine adjuvant therapy, since they work by a diﬀerent mechanism in the cell. The optimum timing of these agents with respect to chemotherapy has not been studied. It is common practice to omit chemotherapy from the systemic therapy adjuvant prescription in postmenopausal women. This practice standard, recommended for some nodal and oestrogen-receptor expression level subgroups in the St Gallen consensus, is based on the small beneﬁt of chemotherapy reported in a meta-analysis10 and in individual trials that showed no added beneﬁt of chemotherapy.7–9 Most of these studies were CMF-based, prescribed tamoxifen concurrently with chemotherapy, used intravenous cyclophosphamide in the CMF regimen, or prospectively lowered doses of chemotherapy in relation to increasing patient age. Instead, our results suggest that anthracycline-based approaches for approximately 6 months could help to achieve maximum beneﬁt from chemoendocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptorwww.thelancet.com Vol 374 December 19/26, 2009 

positive breast cancer. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) reported a diseasefree survival advantage from four cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide added to tamoxifen over tamoxifen alone, but overall survival in the two groups was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (p=0·08), although premenopausal patients and those with receptor-negative disease were also included in the study.30 Another group reported an advantage in disease-free survival but not in overall survival of six cycles of ﬂuorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer and one to three positive nodes.31 There are several limitations to our study. First, we do not know which women would beneﬁt from added chemotherapy compared with endocrine therapy alone. A subset of women with oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer have endocrine-responsive tumours (deﬁned by very high levels of receptor expression) that show diﬀerent biology and might not be as responsive to chemotherapy.4,9 The beneﬁt of CAF seen in our study might not occur in all patient subsets. A separate report addresses this important question of chemotherapy beneﬁt within biological subsets.27 Second, this study was done in the era before standard determination of HER2 (ERBB2) status of the breast tumour; therefore, some of the chemotherapy beneﬁt might have occurred in the HER2-positive subgroup within this trial population. This important issue is also considered in the separate report.27 Third, the small sample size (by current standards) limits the power to make deﬁnitive conclusions in key subgroups. Finally, there was no central determination of oestrogen-receptor status to conﬁrm the institutional designation of positive. This aspect was addressed in the separate report.27 The disease-free survival advantage from CAF-based treatment was not without signiﬁcant toxicity in some women, such that the frequent as well as more infrequent toxicities and late events seen should be fully presented at time of the treatment decision-making process. There was an increased risk of thrombotic episodes during the ﬁrst year of chemoendocrine therapy, as reported by others,8 and no diﬀerence in the risk between CAF-T and CAFT. Congestive heart failure was uncommon, but occurred at a greater frequency in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups than in the tamoxifen-alone group; the anthracycline was probably responsible for this adverse event. The risk of late acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome was less than 1%, but the conditions were only seen in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups (no diﬀerence between CAFT and CAF-T) and not in the tamoxifen-alone group. We believe that for postmenopausal women with few comorbidities who have a substantial risk of recurrence or death based on the prognostic proﬁle of their tumour, the risk–beneﬁt balance favours anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen. However, 2061

characteristics of the tumour should also be factored into the risk–beneﬁt ratio. This study shows the necessity of long-term follow-up of adjuvant therapies to determine the outcomes of treatment.
