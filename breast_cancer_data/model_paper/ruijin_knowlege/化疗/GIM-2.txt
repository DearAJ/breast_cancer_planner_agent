Summary Background Whether addition of ﬂuorouracil to epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (EC-P) is favourable in adjuvant treatment of patients with node-positive breast cancer is controversial, as is the beneﬁt of increased density of dosing. We aimed to address these questions in terms of improvements in disease-free survival. Methods In this 2 × 2 factorial, open-label, phase 3 trial, we enrolled patients aged 18–70 years with operable, node positive, early-stage breast cancer from 81 Italian centres. Eligible patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio with a centralised, interactive online system to receive either dose-dense chemotherapy (administered intravenously every 2 weeks with pegﬁlgrastim support) with ﬂuorouracil plus EC-P (FEC-P) or EC-P or to receive standard-interval chemotherapy (administered intravenously every 3 weeks) with FEC-P or EC-P. The primary study endpoint was disease-free survival, assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method in the intention-to-treat population. Our primary comparisons were between dose schedule (every 2 weeks vs every 3 weeks) and dose type (FEC-P vs EC-P). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00433420. Findings Between April 24, 2003, and July 3, 2006, we recruited 2091 patients. 88 patients were enrolled in centres that only provided standard-intensity dosing. After a median follow-up of 7·0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 4·5–6·3), 140 (26%) of 545 patients given EC-P every 3 weeks, 157 (29%) of 544 patients given FEC-P every 3 weeks, 111 (22%) of 502 patients given EC-P every 2 weeks, and 113 (23%) of 500 patients given FEC-P every 2 weeks had a disease-free survival event. For the dose-density comparison, disease-free survival at 5 years was 81% (95% CI 79–84) in patients treated every 2 weeks and 76% (74–79) in patients treated every 3 weeks (HR 0·77, 95% CI 0·65–0·92; p=0·004); overall survival rates at 5 years were 94% (93–96) and 89% (87–91; HR 0·65, 0·51–0·84; p=0·001) and for the chemotherapy-type comparison, disease-free survival at 5 years was 78% (75–81) in the FEC-P groups and 79% (76–82) in the EC-P groups (HR 1·06, 0·89–1·25; p=0·561); overall survival rates at 5 years were 91% (89–93) and 92% (90–94; 1·16, 0·91–1·46; p=0·234). Compared with 3 week dosing, chemotherapy every 2 weeks was associated with increased rate of grade 3–4 of anaemia (14 [1·4%] of 988 patients vs two [0·2%] of 984 patients; p=0·002); transaminitis (19 [1·9%] vs four [0·4%]; p=0·001), and myalgias (31 [3·1%] vs 16 [1·6%]; p=0·019), and decreased rates of grade 3–4 neutropenia (147 [14·9%] vs 433 [44·0%]; p<0·0001). Addition of ﬂuorouracil led to increased rates of grade 3–4 neutropenia (354 [34·5%] of 1025 patients on FEC-P vs 250 [24·2%] of 1032 patients on EC-P; p<0·0001), fever (nine [0·9%] vs two [0·2%]), nausea (47 [4·6%] vs 28 [2·7%]), and vomiting (32 [3·1%] vs 15 [1·4%]). Interpretation In patients with node-positive early breast cancer, dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy improved disease-free survival compared with standard interval chemotherapy. Addition of ﬂuorouracil to a sequential EC-P regimen was not associated with an improved disease-free survival outcome. Funding Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pharmacia, and Dompè Biotec. 

Introduction Chemotherapy regimens that combine anthracyclines and taxanes improve the outcome of patients with earlystage breast cancer.1 The most widely used anthracyclinebased regimens in sequential combinations with taxanes are doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) and ﬂuorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) or ﬂuorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC). The contribution of ﬂuorouracil to the anthracycline- 

cyclophospamide regimens (AC or EC) has not been deﬁned. Various randomised trials2–5 attempted to assess the role of dose-dense chemotherapy in patients with earlystage breast cancer. Most of these trials had important diﬀerences between the dose-dense and control groups in terms of number of cycles, dose size, type of drug, and total dose, thus rendering interpretation of which variable contributed to the observed results diﬃcult. The few randomised trials with an adequate study design,6–8

that is, trials that assessed the same drugs and doses in the dose-dense and control groups, reported conﬂicting results. Therefore, the role of dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer is still controversial.9,10 We aimed to establish whether an FEC followed by paclitaxel (FEC-P) regimen would improve disease-free survival compared with the same regimen without ﬂuorouracil (EC-P) and whether the dose-dense schedule would improve disease-free survival compared with a standard-interval schedule. 

Methods Study design and patients This study was a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial, with a 2 × 2 factorial design aiming to address both the role of the addition of ﬂuorouracil to the chemotherapy with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel and the role of the dose-dense schedule in the adjuvant treatment of patients with node-positive breast cancer. This study was done in 81 Italian centres by the Gruppo Italiano Mammella (GIM). Women were eligible if they met the following criteria: histologically proven unilateral operable invasive breast cancer conﬁned to the breast and ipsilateral axilla, primary surgery with lumpectomy or total mastectomy plus axillary nodal dissection, histological evidence of tumour in at least one axillary lymph node, age 18 to 70 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or lower, normal organ and bone marrow functions, and use of adequate contraception methods for potentially fertile women. Patients had to be randomly assigned within 5 weeks of the date of their last surgery. Oestrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR) positive tumours were deﬁned by a ﬁnding of at least 10% of positive cells by immunohistochemical analysis. HER2 positive tumours were deﬁned by a ﬁnding of at least 10% of tumour cells with HER2 protein expression assessed by an immunohistochemistry assay or by a positivity of an in-situ hybridisation assay. The study was coordinated by GIM group, who were responsible for the study design, randomisation, collection and management of data, medical review, data analysis, and reporting. The full study protocol is available online. The study was approved by ethics committees of all participating institutions. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before study entry. 

every 3 weeks [standard-interval chemotherapy]) followed by four cycles of intravenous paclitaxel 175 mg/m² on day 1, every 3 weeks (q3EC-P group); four cycles of standard-interval intravenous FEC (ﬂuorouracil 600 mg/m², epirubicin 90 mg/m², cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m², on day 1, every 3 weeks) followed by four cycles of intravenous paclitaxel 175 mg/m² on day 1, every 3 weeks, (q3FEC-P group); dose-dense EC-P regimen, with the same doses and drugs as the q3EC-P group, but administered every 2 weeks (dose-dense chemotherapy; q2EC-P group); and the dose-dense FEC-P regimen, with the same doses and drugs as the q3FEC-P group, but given every 2 weeks (q2FEC-P). Randomisation was done by a centralised, interactive internet-based system that after a summary check of patient’s eligibility, generated the random allocation. The only stratiﬁcation factor was centre: within each centre, permuted blocks of size 12 in random sequence were used (block size was four in the ﬁve centres that randomised only to FEC-P vs EC-P). We used an open-label design because the procedures needed to mask the diﬀerences between the treatment groups in the timing of treatment administration (every 2 vs every 3 weeks) were not deemed acceptable from an ethical viewpoint. 

Procedures Patients enrolled in the q2 groups receiving treatment every 2 weeks also received subcutaneous pegﬁlgrastim (6 mg) 24 h after chemotherapy. Because of the occurrence of early leucocytosis (white blood cells in the blood >50 cells per mL), an amendment in March, 2004, needed the provision of pegﬁlgrastim 72 h after chemotherapy. Chemotherapy dose reductions and delays for clinically signiﬁcant grade 3 or 4 haematological and non-haematological toxic eﬀects were done according to protocol-deﬁned criteria. After completion of chemotherapy, patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumours received endocrine therapy. After the approval of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2 positive early breast cancer, an amendment, in April, 2006, needed trastuzumab treatment for 1 year after the completion of chemotherapy for all patients with HER2 positive tumours. Radiation therapy after completion of chemotherapy was mandatory for patients who had a lumpectomy. For patients who had a mastectomy, radiation therapy was done according to each participating institution guidelines. 

Randomisation and masking 

Outcomes 

Eligible patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the four study groups. In ﬁve centres, which refused the randomisation to the dose-dense treatment group, allocations were only to two groups in a 1:1 ratio (standard interval EC-P and standard interval FEC-P). The four study groups were the following (ﬁgure 1): four cycles of standard-interval intravenous EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m², cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m², on day 1, 

The two primary comparisons were between FEC-P and EC-P, and between dose-dense and standard-interval chemotherapy. The primary study endpoint was diseasefree survival; secondary endpoints included overall survival and safety. Disease-free survival was computed from the date of randomisation to the date of local recurrence, distant metastases, contralateral or ipsilateral breast tumour

(excluding ductal carcinoma in situ), second primary malignancy, death from any cause, and loss to follow-up or end of study, whichever came ﬁrst. Disease-free survival times of patients without a disease-free survival event when lost to follow-up or at the time of study closure were censored on the date of the last contact. The deﬁnition of disease-free survival corresponds to the Invasive Disease Free Survival deﬁned by Hudis and colleagues.11 Similarly, overall survival was computed from the day of randomisation to the date of death from any cause, loss to follow-up, or the end of study. Adverse events were assessed clinically and by haematological and biochemical measurements throughout chemotherapy. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria version 2.0.12 

Statistical analysis Our power calculations, based on previous data,13 assumed a 5 year disease-free survival of about 75% in the control group (q3EC-P). Furthermore, we assumed that the minimum therapeutic eﬀect worth detecting in this study, in view of the increased toxic eﬀects associated with the experimental treatments, was a 20% relative reduction in disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]=0·80), corresponding to a 4·4% absolute increase in 5-year disease-free survival. To detect with an 80% power and a signiﬁcance 5% (two-sided), a 20% relative reduction in the risk of relapse in either comparison (EC-P vs FEC-P and dose-dense vs standard interval chemotherapy), 635 disease-free survival events had to be observed. We estimated that to observe 635 events, 1500 patients needed to be enrolled, with an average

follow-up of 7–8 years, or 2000 patients with an average follow-up of 5·5–6 years. We planned the ﬁnal analysis once we had observed 635 events. No formal intermediate analyses were planned. However, in March, 2013, 10 years after the enrolment of the ﬁrst patient, the Steering Committee of the study, in view of the fact that the study had enrolled 2091 patients that had been followed for a median of 7·0 years, and that, so far, the total number of disease-free survival events was still close to 500, decided

to proceed with the ﬁnal analysis of the study and to publish its results, because to wait the 2 or more years that would have been necessary to achieve the target number of 635 events was not deemed appropriate. This decision was based only on information about the event rates in the four treatment groups combined, and was entirely masked to treatment-speciﬁc data and results, thereby avoiding any bias related to an unplanned interim analysis. On the basis of the ﬁnal number of events recorded at the closing date (521 events; May 9, 2013), the power to detect the target HR of 0·80 was decreased to 72%, whereas an 80% power was available for a HR of 0·785. The two primary comparisons were between FEC-P and EC-P, and between dose-dense and standard-interval chemotherapy. All statistical analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis and all protocol violators were analysed within their randomised groups. The presence of an interaction between the two study factors (FEC-P vs EC-P) and dosing every 2 weeks vs every 3 weeks) was assessed by ﬁtting two multivariate Cox models to the data, one for disease-free survival and the other for overall survival. Only patients enrolled in centres that randomised to all four treatment groups were included in these analyses. In each of these two models, only three factors were included, the two treatment assignments (dosing type and dosing frequency) and the interaction term between them. The signiﬁcance of the interaction between the two treatments was assessed by means of a backward procedure, based on the likelihood ratio test. The two primary study hypotheses were tested independently by comparison of disease-free survival in the groups of patients assigned to EC-P with those assigned to FEC-P, and comparison of those in the 2 weeks group with those in the 3 weeks group. We used a stratiﬁed logrank test to assess the signiﬁcance of the diﬀerences between the disease-free survival curves, where the stratiﬁcation factor for the EC-P versus the FEC-P comparison was the assignment to 2 week or 3 week dosing, whereas for the comparison between dose-dense versus standard-interval chemotherapy, the stratiﬁcation factor was assignment to EC-P or FEC-P. In all analyses focused on dose-density, we excluded patients enrolled to the ﬁve centres that randomised only to standard-interval EC-P and standard-interval FEC-P and did not randomise to dose schedule. The same procedures were used in the analyses of overall survival. Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimators were plotted to describe disease-free survival and overall survival in EC-P and FEC-P groups, adding together patients in the dose schedule groups, and for q2 and q3 groups, adding together patients in the two drug groups. To provide estimates of treatment eﬀects adjusted for potential confounding factors, and to assess the consistency of these estimates across strata of these factors (subgroup analyses), we ﬁtted several multivariate Cox

disease-free survival and overall survival models to the data. These analyses were done separately for the FEC-P versus EC-P and for the 3 week and 2 week comparisons. The following covariates were included in the models: age, menopausal status, type of surgery, histological type, tumour size, nodal status, grade, HER2 status, and hormonal receptors. In a substantial proportion of patients (57 [3%] patients) the information about the grade of the primary tumour was missing. To avoid the exclusion from all multivariate analyses, the grade of these patients was reclassiﬁed, according to the procedure reported in the appendix. For subgroup analyses, the interaction terms between the treatment group and each of the prognostic factors were introduced in the model one at a time. The statistical signiﬁcance of the interaction term was then assessed by a backward procedure based on the likelihood ratio test. Proportionality was tested with Schoenfeld residuals. The same procedures were repeated for the subgroup analyses of overall survival. Because of the absence of any correction for multiple testing, and the fact that no subgroup analysis was anticipated in the study protocol, the results of these analyses (ie, tests for interactions) are to be thought of as merely exploratory and any signiﬁcant results must be considered with caution. Forest plots were used to summarise the results of various subgroup analyses. All reported p values are two-sided. We used SPSS version 20.0 for all statistical analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00433420. 

Role of the funding source The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. LDM, SDP, and the statistician (PB) had full access to all of the data and had ﬁnal responsibility for the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. 

Results Between April 24, 2003 and July 3, 2006, 2091 patients entered the study. Of these, 2003 patients were randomly assigned to four treatment groups, while 88 were randomly assigned only to q3FEC-P and q3EC-P (ﬁgure 1). The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to demographic and tumour characteristics (table 1). The planned number of chemotherapy cycles was completed by almost 90% of patients in every group (ﬁgure 1). The relative dose-intensity was 99% in the q3EC-P group, 98% in the q3FEC-P group, 98% in the q2EC-Pgroup, and 98% in the q2FEC-P group (a complete summary of treatment compliance and doseintensity is provided in the appendix). Patients with HER2-positive disease who were enrolled after the approval of adjuvant trastuzumab in April, 2006, received trastuzumab for 1 year; overall 130 (27%) of 480 patients with HER2-positive tumours received trastuzumab: 40 (33%) patients in the q3EC-P group, 32 (24%) in the 

q3FEC-P group, 26 (25%) in the q2EC-P group, and 32 (26%) in the q2FEC-P group. As of May 9, 2013, after a median follow-up of 7·0 years (IQR 4·5–6·3), 521 (25% of patients) disease-free survival events occurred in the overall study population. 266 (13%) deaths occurred in total (table 2). No interaction was seen between the eﬀect of two randomisation variables (FEC-P vs EC-P and dense vs standard-interval dosing) on disease-free survival (pinteraction=0·628) or overall survival (pinteraction=0·889), making it possible to analyse the two study factors independently. 270 disease-free survival events occurred in the two FEC-P groups combined and 251 occurred in the two EC-P groups combined. The estimated rates of diseasefree survival at 5 years were 78% (95% CI 75–81) in the FEC-P group and 79% (76–82) in the EC-P group (p=0·561; ﬁgure 2). Overall survival rates at 5 years were 91% (89–93) in the FEC-P group and 92% (90–94) EC-P group (p=0·234; ﬁgure 2). The similar outcome between patients assigned to FEC-P and EC-P was conﬁrmed in multivariate analyses, where the comparisons between FEC-P and EC-P were adjusted for prognostic factors (HR for disease-free survival 1·02, 95% CI 0·86–1·22, p=0·812 and for overall survival (1·07; 0·84–1·37, p=0·578; data not shown). In subgroup analyses (appendix), no evidence of interaction was observed between FEC-P or EC-P and any factor, with the exception of nodal status, for which a signiﬁcant interaction was seen (p=0·011) for disease-free survival only. However, the interaction was attributable to the diﬀerence in favour of the EC-P group observed in patients with 4–9 aﬀected lymph nodes, without any discernible trend of increasing or decreasing HR. 224 disease-free survival events occurred in the two groups given chemotherapy every 2 weeks and 270 in the two groups given chemotherapy every 3 weeks. The estimated rates of disease-free survival at 5 years were 81% (95% CI 79–84) in the dose dense group and 76% (74–79) in the standard interval groups (p=0·004; ﬁgure 2). q3EC-P group (n=545)

Figure 2: Disease-free survival and overall survival Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease-free survival (A) and overall survival (B) in EC-P and FEC-P groups. Kaplan-MeIer estimates of disease-free survival (C) and overall survival (D) in dose-dense and standard interval chemotherapy groups. EC-P=epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, followed by paclitaxel. FEC-P=ﬂuorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, followed by paclitaxel. 

Overall estimated survival rates at 5 years were 94% (93–96) in the dose dense group and 89% (87–91) in the standard interval group (p=0·001; ﬁgure 2). These diﬀerences were conﬁrmed in multivariate analyses, in which the comparisons between dose times were adjusted for prognostic factors (HR for disease-free survival 0·78; 0·65–0·94, p=0·008 and HR for overall survival 0·66; 0·51–0·85, p=0·002; data not shown). A remarkable consistency in the diﬀerence between 2 week and 3 week dosing was observed in subgroup analyses of disease-free survival (appendix). No signiﬁcant interaction was seen between type of regimen and any of the prognostic factors. In subgroup analyses of overall survival (appendix), a signiﬁcant interaction was observed between treatment assignment and tumour size (p=0·043), with no eﬀect seen in patients with pT1 tumours (HR 0·98). No noteworthy variation in the HRs was observed in other subgroups considered. 6 

The eﬀect of 2 week or 3 week dosing on disease-free survival did not diﬀer according to hormone-receptor status (HR=0·80, 95% CI 0·65–0·98 in hormone-receptorpositive patients; HR=0·69, 0·48–0·99 in hormonereceptor-negative patients; pinteraction=0·43; appendix). For hormone-receptor positive patients, the 5 year diseasefree survival was 83% (81–86) with the dose dense schedule and 80% (77–83; p=0·033) with the standard interval schedule; and for hormone-receptor negative patients, 71% (64–78) with the dose dense schedule and 61% (53–69; p=0·046) in with the standard interval schedule (ﬁgure 3). The eﬀect of the schedule on overall survival was similar in hormone-receptor-positive (HR 0·69, 0·51–0·94) and hormone-receptor-negative patients (HR 0·55, 0·34–0·90; pinteraction=0·423). No signiﬁcant interaction occurred between tras tuzumab therapy and the eﬀect of the dose-dense schedule (pinteraction=0·728 for disease-free survival and pinteraction=0·679

Discussion This trial shows that, in women with node-positive breast cancer, the sequential treatment regimen FEC-P did not improve disease-free survival compared with the same regimen without ﬂuorouracil (EC-P), whereas the dosedense regimen was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in the risk of recurrence and death compared with standard-interval chemotherapy. Both AC/EC and FAC/FEC14 are widely used in the sequential treatment regimens with anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy and taxanes, and no data are available so far to support the choice between the treatment with or without ﬂuorouracil. The ﬁndings of this trial suggest that, at least in sequential regimens with anthracyclines and paclitaxel, the addition of ﬂuorouracil to the EC-P regimen was associated with an increase in toxic eﬀects (grade 3–4 neutropenia, fever, nausea, and vomiting) whereas we observed no additional outcome beneﬁts. Although, the role of ﬂuorouracil in the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer cannot be completely discarded, the lack of eﬃcacy noted in our study raises a general question on the opportunity to include it in modern adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, especially if the increase in toxic eﬀects associated with its use is taken into account. An important ﬁnding of this study is that the provision

for overall survival) even though, in the subgroup of patients with HER2-positive tumours treated with trastuzumab, the eﬀect of dose dense therapy was smaller (HR 0·99; 95% CI 0·49–1·99 for disease-free survival and HR 0·93 0·35–2·54 for overall survival). Subgroup analyses according to HER2 status and treatment with trastuzumab are shown in the appendix. Table 3 shows major (occurring in at least 5% of the population) toxic eﬀects that occurred in the four groups. Grade 3–4 toxic eﬀects that occurred in the standard interval and dose-dense groups are reported in the appendix. Patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy, compared with those treated with q3 regimens, more frequently had grade 3–4 anaemia (14 [1·4%] of 988 patients vs two [0·2%] of 984 patients; p=0·002), transaminitis (19 [1·9%] vs four [0·4%]; p=0·001), and myalgias (31 [3·1%] vs 16 [1·6%], p=0·019), and less frequently had grade 3–4 neutropenia (147 [14·9%] vs 433 [44·0%]; p<0·0001). The appendix shows grade 3–4 toxic eﬀects that occurred in the EC-P and FEC-P groups. Grade 3–4 neutropenia, fever, nausea, and vomiting were signiﬁcantly more frequent in patients treated with FEC-P than in patients treated with EC-P. We noted one case of acute myeloid leukaemia and one case of myelodysplastic syndrome, both in the q2EC-P arm. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Five patients (two patients in the q3EC-P group, one in the q3FEC-P group, one in the q2EC-P group, and one in the q2FEC-P group) died from early tumour recurrence within 1 year of randomisation.

of dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with a signiﬁcant and clinically relevant disease-free survival and overall survival beneﬁt compared with standard interval chemotherapy: the observed reduction from 24% to 19%, in the cumulative 5-year risk of invasive disease or death, corresponds to a hazard ratio of 0·78. Even more impressive was the eﬀect on overall survival, for which we observed a reduction in 5-year cumulative mortality from 11% to 6%, for a hazard ratio of 0·66. The role of dose-dense chemotherapy, as adjuvant treatment for patients with breast cancer, was assessed in various phase 3 studies, but the most of these trials compared dose-dense chemotherapy with regimens that use standard intervals but with diﬀerent drugs or dose in the treatment groups, thus making diﬃcult to extrapolate the true role of a dose-dense strategy.2–5 Few studies6–8 compared the same chemotherapy regimen administered

Panel: Research in context Systematic review We searched PubMed for articles about dose-dense regimens and ﬂuorouracil in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer without language or date restriction. Additionally, we searched the abstract of major oncology congresses. A pooled analysis10 of randomised trials showed that chemotherapy regimens with an increased dose-density are associated with an improved overall survival and disease-free survival. However, in most studies diﬀerences were reported between the dose-dense and control groups in terms of number of cycles, dose size, type of drugs and total dose, thus making interpretation of which variable contributed to the observed results diﬃcult.2–5 Of the few randomised studies with an adequate design to speciﬁcally address the role of dose-dense, the CALGB B9741 study6 showed a beneﬁt of dose-dense chemotherapy, mainly restricted to hormone-receptor-negative tumours; 15 the GONO-MIG trial7 showed a trend toward a beneﬁt of dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy, and, conversely, results from the UK TACT2 trial8 showed no beneﬁt of this chemotherapy schedule. The GIM2 trial, beside assessment of the role of dose-density, was unique in addressing the role of the addition of ﬂuorouracil to the chemotherapy regimen with anthracycline-cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel. Interpretation This GIM2 trial supports the increased eﬃcacy of dose-dense chemotherapy and suggests that the beneﬁt is present in both hormone-receptor-negative and hormone-receptorpositive tumours. Our results ﬁrst show that the addition of ﬂuorouracil to anthracycline and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel is not associated with an improved outcome compared with the same treatment without ﬂuorouracil. 

every 2 or every 3 weeks. A dose-dense chemotherapy approach using concurrent doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel was assessed in the Cancer and Leukaemia Group B 9741 trial, 6 which showed a signiﬁcant improvement in disease-free survival and overall survival for the dose-dense chemotherapy group. The Italian Gruppo Oncologico Nord OvestMammella Intergruppo Trial assessed the dose-dense approach in a non-taxane-based regimen. Although 8 

numerically improved outcome in the dose-dense group was observed, the diﬀerence was not statistically signiﬁcant.7 The UK TACT2 trial, 8 so far presented only in abstract form, compared standard chemotherapy with epirubicin followed by CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, ﬂuorouracil) or capecitabine to dose-dense epirubicin and, at a median follow-up of 49 months, showed no diﬀerence in disease-free survival between the two treatment strategies. The pooled analysis of randomised trials showed that dose-dense chemotherapy results in better overall and disease-free survival.10 However, because of the paucity of randomised controlled trials with an adequate design, additional data from randomised trials were claimed to be necessary to better clarify the role of dose-dense chemotherapy. Our ﬁndings underline the results of the CALGB B9741 trial and support the clinically relevant beneﬁt associated with the dosedense strategy in regimens based on the sequential provision of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy followed by paclitaxel. In the CALBGB trial, dose-dense chemotherapy was particularly eﬀective in patients with hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer, whereas the beneﬁt in hormone-receptor-positive patients was smaller and not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that observed with standard-interval chemotherapy.15 Our results, instead, show that the beneﬁts of dose-dense chemotherapy are present in hormone-receptor-positive patients as well. However, because of the underrepresentation of hormone receptor-negative patients (only 17% of the overall study population) in our study, the statistical power of the test for interaction between hormone receptor status and dosedensity was limited, and then a diﬀerence in the magnitude of beneﬁt of dose-dense chemotherapy in the two groups of patients (hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative) cannot be completely ruled out. The outcome improvement observed in hormone-

receptor-positive patients might be due to the longer follow-up (median 7·0 years [IQR 4·5–6·3]) of our study compared than in other studies.15 In fact, the pattern of risks over time is diﬀerent in hormone-receptor-negative and hormone-receptor-positive patients: in the ﬁrst few years after surgery the risk of relapse is high in hormonereceptor-negative patients and very low in hormonereceptor-positive patients, in whom a substantial number of events are observed after the ﬁfth year. This pattern of recurrence suggests that a long follow-up is necessary to observe the potential beneﬁt of adjuvant treatment in hormone-receptor-positive patients. Because of the small proportion of patients with HER2positive tumours treated with trastuzumab, no signiﬁcant interaction was seen between trastuzumab therapy and the eﬀect of the dose-dense schedule. However, the lack of a clear eﬀect in patients with HER2-positive tumours treated with trastuzumab suggests that the eﬃcacy of dose-dense chemotherapy might be less noticeable or absent in this subgroup of patients. The main limitation to the generalisability of the dosedense regimen tested in the present study might be the schedule of paclitaxel. At the time the study was planned, paclitaxel at the dose of 175 mg/m² every 3 weeks, was the standard schedule in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. The demonstration that weekly paclitaxel is more eﬀective than the every 3 weeks schedule, only came in 2008, 2 years after the end of recruitment in our trial.16 Since then, the 3 weekly paclitaxel is no longer a standard treatment and has been replaced by 12 cycles of weekly paclitaxel. Nevertheless, recent results from the SWOG S0221 phase 3 trial showed that dose-dense paclitaxel, given every 2 weeks, is similar, in terms of both diseasefree survival and overall survival, to weekly paclitaxel and then, that either dose-dense and weekly regimen are acceptable schedules of paclitaxel administration.17 Yet, in that study, grade 3–4 toxic eﬀects were higher with the dose-dense administration than with weekly administration of paclitaxel, thus suggesting that weekly paclitaxel might be a better option than dose-dense paclitaxel. An additional limitation of our trial is that the study design does not allow separation between the eﬀect of dose-dense (F)EC vs dose-dense paclitaxel, leaving the possibility that the intensiﬁcation of either (F)EC or paclitaxel might be suﬃcient to obtain the full beneﬁt observed with the whole dose-dense regimen. Moreover, no correction for multiple testing was planned to account fo the 2 primary analyses conducted in this trial (FEC-P vs EC-P and q2 vs q3), since this correction is not considered necessary in factorial trials.18 At any rate, the use of a stricter (eg, p=0·0253 using the Bonferroni correction) criterion for statistical signiﬁcance would not change the interpretation of either comparison. Dose-dense chemotherapy was conﬁrmed to be more toxic than standard-interval chemotherapy, with the exception of neutropenia, that, in view of the provision of pegﬁlgrastim, was less frequent in the dose-dense group. 

The use of pegﬁlgrastim is still considered investigational in the setting of dose-dense chemotherapy.19 Our data showing that pegﬁlgrastim, given after 72 h, is safe and feasible in dose-dense regimens,20 are supported by ﬁndings from a prospectively randomised study,21 which showed that pegﬁlgrastim after 72 h has a similar eﬃcacy of pegﬁlgrastim after 24 h and is associated with a lower incidence of grade 3–4 leucopenia. The observed incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodisplastic syndrome, two cases in 1002 patients (0·19%) treated with dose-dense chemotherapy, is similar to that generally reported in dose-dense studies22 and should be considered in view of the 52 fewer deaths observed in the dose-dense groups than in the standard interval groups (panel). Contributors LDM, PB, SDP, FC, and MDL designed the study and analysed, interpreted, and collected data. LDM and PB wrote and approved the ﬁnal report. SDP, MDL, C, GC, AD, AT, CN, EV, OG, FP, FM, SB, AA, TG, GC, MG, AG, PP, CB, GB, VF, and FC were involved in data collection, report revision, and ﬁnal approval of the report.
