Purpose Administration of anthracycline and taxane therapy in the adjuvant setting is considered a standard for breast cancer. We evaluated a non–anthracycline-based regimen in TOP2A-normal patients. Patients and Methods In this multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, 2,012 women with early TOP2A-normal breast cancer and at least one high-risk factor were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/ m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) every 3 weeks (DC) or three cycles of epirubicin (90 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) followed by three cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m2; EC-D). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) after a median of 5 years of follow-up. Secondary end points were patient-reported toxicity, overall survival (OS), and distant disease–free survival. Results At a median estimated potential follow-up of 69 months, 5-year DFS was 87.9% (95% CI, 85.6% to 89.8%) in the EC-D arm and 88.3% (95% CI, 86.1% to 90.1%) in the DC arm. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the risk of DFS events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.28; P = 1.00), distant disease–free survival (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.47; P = .40), or mortality (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.59; P = .41) in the intent-to-treat analysis. A signiﬁcant interaction between menopausal status and treatment group was observed for DFS (P = .04) but not for OS (P = .07). Patients with grade 3 tumors derived most beneﬁt from DC, and patients with grade 1 to 2 tumors derived most beneﬁt from EC-D (DFS: interaction P = .02; and OS: interaction P = .03). Patients receiving EC-D reported signiﬁcantly more stomatitis, myalgia or arthralgia, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy, whereas edema was more frequent after DC. Conclusion This study provides evidence to support no overall outcome beneﬁt from adjuvant anthracyclines in patients with early TOP2A-normal breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION ASSOCIATED CONTENT See accompanying Oncology Grand Rounds on page 2600 Appendix DOI: https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO. 2017.72.3494 Data Supplement DOI: https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO. 2017.72.3494 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2017. 72.3494 

For the past 40 years, adjuvant chemotherapy has improved the survival of an increasing proportion of patients with early breast cancer. The metaanalyses of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group have shown that the beneﬁt of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and ﬂuorouracil (CMF) was largely independent of patient and tumor characteristics as well as concomitant tamoxifen and that an incremental beneﬁt was obtained from adding an anthracycline to CMF, from 

substituting methotrexate with doxorubicin or epirubicin, and from administering taxanes concurrently or in sequence with anthracyclines.1,2 On average, the beneﬁt achieved by anthracyclines has only been modest, and evidence has suggested that molecular characteristics of the tumor are essential. Overexpression and ampliﬁcation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was retrospectively associated with a signiﬁcant beneﬁt from anthracyclines in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trials B11 and MA.5.3,4 Only patients with HER2-normal breast cancer were included in the © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

Anthracyclines in Early Breast Cancer (ABC) trials and seemed to derive some beneﬁts from anthracyclines because the joint analysis was unable to demonstrate noninferiority of adjuvant docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (DC) compared with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel.5 TOP2A encodes topoisomerase IIa, an essential enzyme resolving topologic DNA constraints and a direct target of anthracyclines.6,7 An association between alterations in copy number of TOP2A and incremental beneﬁt from substituting methotrexate in CMF with epirubicin was demonstrated in the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) 89D trial.8,9 A pooled analysis of the DBCG 89D trial together with four additional phase III trials conﬁrmed a greater beneﬁt of anthracyclines in patients with TOP2A alterations and a trend toward greater beneﬁt in patients with HER2-ampliﬁed tumors.9 Provided that beneﬁt of anthracyclines is largely conﬁned to the subgroup of patients with TOP2A-altered tumors, then patients with TOP2Anormal tumors could potentially be spared from anthracyclines as part of their adjuvant chemotherapy. The DBCG 07-READ (randomized trial of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel against docetaxel and cyclophosphamide) trial compared six cycles of DC with three cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by three cycles of docetaxel (EC-D) in patients with TOP2A-normal tumors. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS DBCG 07-READ (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT00689156) was a nationwide, multicenter, open-label, two-arm, phase III, randomized trial. DBCG coordinated the trial and was responsible for study design, random assignment, collection and management of data, analysis of data, and reporting.10 The National Danish Ethics Committee (H-D-2008-009) approved the trial, and all participants provided written, informed consent before enrollment. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible patients included node-positive and node-negative high-risk patients (age younger than 39 years, tumor size . 20 mm, grade 2 or 3 ductal carcinoma, estrogen receptor [ER] negative [, 10% positive], and/ or HER2 positive) after complete resection of a TOP2A-normal invasive carcinoma.11 Exclusion criteria included the following: pregnancy or breastfeeding; Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) . 2; earlier medical cancer treatment; treatment with a nonapproved product within 30 days; bilateral, locally advanced, or distant disease; and prior malignant disease within 5 years. Patients with any HER2 status were eligible. 

Procedures Tumor blocks were submitted to one of the three regional pathology laboratories, and two invasive tissue cores were transferred to a recipient tissue microarray block, as previously described.12 TOP2A normal was deﬁned as a signal-to-centromere 17 ratio of 0.8 to 1.9 by ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (TOP2A pharmDX; Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) as speciﬁed in the US Food and Drug Administration approval (Code K5333) and otherwise as altered.11 A customized version of DBCG’s Clinical Data Management System was used for random 1:1 assignment using permuted blocks stratiﬁed by institution. Eligible patients with no comorbidity (CCI = 0) were assigned to EC-D (three cycles of epirubicin 90 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, then three cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m2) or six cycles of DC (docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2) both given intravenously on day 1 every 3 weeks. In patients with a CCI of 1 or 2, drug doses were reduced initially (epirubicin 60 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 2640

500 mg/m2, then docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in EC-D arm or docetaxel 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 in DC arm). In both groups, docetaxel was accompanied by colony-stimulating factor. Chemotherapy doses were adjusted according to WBC and platelet counts on day 1 of the scheduled cycle as follows: platelets . 100 3 109/L and WBC . 3.5 3 109/L, 100% of drugs; and platelets 75 to 100 3 109/L or WBC 2.0 to 3.5 3 109/L, 50% of all three drugs. For platelets , 75 3 109/L or WBC , 2.0 3 109/L, the treatment was delayed for 1 week. Patientreported outcomes were collected by questionnaires before the start of chemotherapy (baseline), on day 20 after each of six cycles, and 6 months after the sixth cycle. The questionnaire was built on a Danish translation of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 and allowed patients to rank predeﬁned adverse effects from 0 (none) to 4 (functional impact). In node-negative patients, radiotherapy was administered to the residual breast after breast-conserving surgery, and in node-positive (macrometastatic) patients, radiotherapy was administered to regional nodes and residual breast or chest wall at completion of chemotherapy. Ovarian suppression was not allowed, and patients with hormone receptor–positive tumors were allocated to tamoxifen 20 mg per day (if premenopausal) or letrozole 2.5 mg per day (if postmenopausal) for 5 years. Patients with HER2-positive tumors were given trastuzumab intravenously every 3 weeks initiated at cycle 4 and continued for 17 cycles. Physical examinations were performed at baseline before administration of chemotherapy, at 3 and 6 months after completion of chemotherapy, every 6 months during years 2 to 5, and yearly during years 5 to 10. Mammograms were done every second year in women age 50 years or older and annually in younger women. Additional biochemical tests and imaging were done when indicated by symptoms or signs. Clinical followup was continued until ﬁrst event or a maximum of 10 years. A complete follow-up on vital status was obtained until October 1, 2016, for all patients through linkage to the Danish Central Population Registry. After completion of clinical follow-up, secondary malignancies were obtained through linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry and the Danish Patient Registry. 

Outcomes The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), which was deﬁned as time from random assignment to any ﬁrst event of invasive ipsilateral or contralateral breast recurrence, local or regional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence, second (nonbreast) invasive cancer, or death from any cause. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and distant disease–free survival (DDFS). OS was deﬁned as time from random assignment until death from any cause. DDFS was deﬁned as time from random assignment to distant recurrence, death from any cause, or second (nonbreast) invasive cancer, whereas other ﬁrst events were considered competing risk events. Statistical Analysis The statistical power was estimated under the following assumptions. According to the DBCG database, the expected 3-year DFS rate was 82% after EC-D. Approximately 1,150 patients would be eligible annually for TOP2A testing, and 920 (85%) would, according to DBCG 89D, have a TOP2A-normal tumor. Approximately 70% of patients were expected to consent to participate. With a recruitment of 1,910 patients in 3 years, after 5 years of follow-up, the study would have 80% power (P = .05 signiﬁcance level) to detect a 36% improvement with DC compared with EC-D.8,10 Follow-up time was quantiﬁed in terms of a Kaplan-Meier estimate of potential follow-up. OS and DFS were analyzed unadjusted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and groups were compared using the log-rank test. Unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from the Cox proportional hazards regression model to quantify the effect of treatment regimen. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were applied to explore interactions (Appendix Table A1, online only). Multiple fractional polynomial was used for model building.13 Interactions between treatment and JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY

the covariates were investigated in separate models. The assumptions of proportional hazards were assessed by Schoenfeld residuals and by including a time-dependent component in the model. For competing risk analysis, the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model was used. The intentto-treat (ITT) population was used for analysis of DFS, OS, and DDFS. Dose-intensities and adverse event frequencies were calculated for the perprotocol population, censoring at any crossover to another treatment regimen. For each regimen, cycle, and drug combination, mean relative dose-intensities were calculated. Associations between regimen and other characteristics (excluding unknowns) were analyzed by the x2 and Wilcoxon tests. P values are two-tailed. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 14.2 (STATA, College Station, TX) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 

RESULTS 

Between June 2008 and December 2012, after diagnostic workup and deﬁnitive breast surgery, 7,086 Danish women were eligible for TOP2A screening. A central TOP2A analysis was carried out in 5,153 patients, and 4,318 patients (84%) had a TOP2A-normal tumor, whereas 835 (16%) had a TOP2A-altered tumor. Between July 2008 and December 2012, 12 DBCG centers randomly assigned 2,012 eligible patients to EC-D (n = 1,001) or DC (n = 1,011; Fig 1). One patient in the EC-D group and three patients in the DC group emigrated and were censored between 517 and 1,772 days after random assignment. Complete follow-up for survival was achieved for the remaining 2,008 patients. The random assignment was well balanced, with no signiﬁcant differences between the EC-D and DC groups (Table 1). Among the 2,012 patients, two patients from the EC-D arm withdrew consent and were untreated, and in both groups, ﬁve patients self-selected the other arm and crossed over. The mean relative dose-intensity (actual/planned mg/m2) changed similarly

Study Outcome This analysis was conducted 5 years after closure of recruitment. Median estimated potential follow-up was 5 years and 9 months for DFS and 5 years and 11 months for OS. A total of 253 ﬁrst events were observed (Table 2). Figure 3A shows the KaplanMeier curves for DFS. In the ITT analysis (n = 2,012), there was no difference in DFS between the EC-D group and the DC group (overall unadjusted HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.28; P = 1.00). Fiveyear DFS rates were 87.9% (95% CI, 85.6% to 89.8%) for the EC-D group and 88.3% (95% CI, 86.1% to 90.1%) for the DC group. There was no signiﬁcant difference in DDFS between the EC-D and DC groups (unadjusted HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.47; P = .40). Table 2 lists the causes of death. There is no identiﬁable pattern behind the numerical difference of 78 deaths in the DC group compared with 68 deaths in EC-D group, and Figure 3B illustrates that there was no statistical difference in mortality (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.59; P = .41). Five-year OS rates were 94.8% (95% CI, 93.2% to 96.0%) in the EC-D group and 93.9% (95% CI, 92.2% to 95.3%) in the DC group. One patient died of acute myocardial infarction after the third cycle of DC, which was reported by the investigator as unrelated, and there were no other deaths during or within 30 days of chemotherapy. One patient in the ED-C group and two patients in DC group developed

in cycles 1 to 3 and overall in cycles 4 to 6 (Fig 2), whereas more dose reductions in cycle 6 were performed in the ED-C group (0.86) compared with the DC group (0.89; P , .01). Among the 1,440 patients with ER-positive disease, 18 (1%) eluded endocrine treatment. One of 222 patients with HER2-positive disease declined trastuzumab, and among the 1,780 patients recommended adjuvant radiotherapy, 17 declined, whereas the data on 52 patients were missing.

cardiomyopathy after more than 6 years, whereas seven and six additional patients developed heart failure in the ED-C and DC groups, respectively. A second nonbreast primary invasive cancer was observed among 25 patients (2%) in the EC-D group and 27 patients (3%) in the DC group. Notably, two patients in the EC-D group developed acute myeloid leukemia (Table 2). An exploratory ITT analysis of DFS (Fig 4A; Appendix Table A1) and OS (Fig 4B) in subgroups showed similar treatment effects by histologic subtype, nodal status, tumor size, ER expression, HER2 status, and Ki-67 expression but suggested differential effects by menopausal status and malignancy grade. Premenopausal patients had better DFS after DC, and postmenopausal patients had better DFS after EC-D (test of interaction, adjusted P = .04), and there was a suggestion of an effect in the same direction for OS (test of interaction, adjusted P = .07). Allocation to DC was associated with a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in patients with grade 3 tumors, whereas in patients with grade 1 to 2 tumors, allocation to EC-D was associated with improved DFS (test of interaction, adjusted P = .02) and OS (test of interaction, adjusted P = .03). 

Toxicity The overall proportion of patients reporting any acute grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurring during or within 21 days of last chemotherapy was signiﬁcantly different in the two groups (Table 3). Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred more often (P = .01) in patients allocated to EC-D compared with patients allocated to DC. The nonhematologic toxicity proﬁle differed signiﬁcantly (Table 3). Patients allocated to EC-D reported a signiﬁcantly (P , .001) higher grade of stomatitis, myalgia or arthralgia, vomiting, nausea, and fatigue, whereas peripheral edema was more severe after DC. Peripheral neuropathy was signiﬁcantly more common and severe (P = .001) with EC-D than with DC, whereas the rates of JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY

Patients with grade 3 tumors had a favorable outcome from DC, whereas EC-D was more favorable in patients with grade 1 or 2 tumors, and this heterogeneity was signiﬁcant in tests of interaction for DFS as well as OS.

This analysis failed to demonstrate any overall outcome beneﬁt from the anthracycline-containing adjuvant EC-D regimen compared with DC of similar duration in patients with TOP2A-normal tumors. Thus, our trial conﬁrms the results hypothesized by a formal prospective-retrospective analysis of individual patient data from the DBCG 89D trial and four other trials.9,14 Moreover, the sequential EC-D schedule was, apart from peripheral edema, associated with signiﬁcantly more adverse events such as stomatitis, myalgia or arthralgia, peripheral neuropathy, vomiting, nausea, and fatigue. The high frequencies of nonhematologic adverse events may be a result of the use of patient-reported outcomes.15,16 Despite a higher total dose and longer duration of docetaxel in the DC group, a signiﬁcantly higher frequency of early peripheral neuropathy was observed in the EC-D group, which is likely to be explained by a higher dose (100 mg/m2 in the EC-D group v 75 mg/ m2 in DC group) per cycle. We previously have reported a signiﬁcant reduction in the risk of peripheral neuropathy by use of frozen gloves and socks and a more pronounced late recovery in the EC-D group.17 In both groups, docetaxel was accompanied by prophylactic colony-stimulating factor, and this may have been the reason for achieving a similar dose-intensity of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide and DC in the ﬁrst three cycles. In contrast, febrile neutropenia was more pronounced during the following three cycles of docetaxel as compared with DC and may explain more extensive dose reductions. Nonetheless, the expectation of a change in adverse effects by the switch improved treatment adherence in the sequential treatment group.

Ki-67 was not evaluated centrally, which may have been critical, and a predictive value of Ki-67 has not been demonstrated by others.21-23 A high recurrence score was associated with beneﬁt from adding CMF to tamoxifen in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast 

and Bowel Project B-20 trial and from adding cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and ﬂuorouracil to tamoxifen in Southwest Oncology Group trial 8814.24,25 Similarly, a low-risk classiﬁer (luminal A subtype) predicted lack of beneﬁt from cyclophosphamide and CMF among premenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer in DBCG 77B.26 In the MA.5 trial, beneﬁt from cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and ﬂuorouracil as compared with CMF was primarily conﬁned to patients with an HER2-enriched subtype.27 In postmenopausal patients, EC-D was associated with an outcome beneﬁt, whereas DC was favorable in premenopausal

patients. The test of interaction between menopausal status and treatment group was statistically signiﬁcant for DFS but not for OS. Total cyclophosphamide dose received and the use of anthracyclines have been emphasized as most important concerning chemotherapy-induced menopause, whereas taxanes are of less importance.8,28,29 Amenorrhea was equally frequent after DC and EC-D, but in the absence of biochemical monitoring of ovarian function, an endocrine effect may not be completely excluded. Adherence to antiestrogens was similar in the two groups. Several issues should be considered when interpreting the 5year results from this trial. First, our trial was designed as a superiority trial. Although the trial met its recruitment goal, the number of events was lower than expected, as was the resulting statistical power. Second, in the design, emphasis was given to the selection of internationally accepted docetaxel regimens and to using chemotherapy of the same duration, and accordingly, a duration of six cycles was selected to be used in both groups. Third, mechanisms of action unrelated to topoisomerase IIa have been proposed for anthracyclines including genetic instability reﬂected by polysomy of centromere 17 (CEN17) and protection from apoptosis by tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1).30,31 Finally, central testing by a validated, US Food and Drug Administration–approved, and CE labeled TOP2A test was applied in the 07-READ trial. These results may not be applicable using other TOP2A tests because the quality control preformed within the international individual-patient pooled analysis of HER2 and TOP2A revealed a suboptimal reproducibility between different TOP2A platforms and institutions.14 In conclusion, EC-D did not demonstrate any overall outcome advantage compared with DC in patients with a TOP2A-normal
