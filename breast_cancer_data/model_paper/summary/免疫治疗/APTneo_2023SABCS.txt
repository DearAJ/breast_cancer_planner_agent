Introduction § Neoadjuvant dual targeting of HER2 with trastuzumab (H) and pertuzumab (P) plus chemotherapy is the standard of care for highrisk HER2+ breast cancer. § Data show the contribution of the immune system in prognosis and response/resistance to HER2 directed therapies and support the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with anti HER2 antibodies. § In the APTneo trial we test the role of adding atezolizumab to neoadjuvant HP and chemotherapy containing or not containing anthracyclines This presentation is the intellectual property of the author/presenter.

Aims of Study Open-label, randomized phase III trial § The primary aim of the study is to compare event-free survival (EFS, arm A v. arm B) 5 years after randomization of the last patient 

§ Important secondary aim is the rate of pCR (defined as absence of invasive cells in breast and lymph nodes). The primary population for all efficacy endpoints is the ITT (intent-to-treat) population § Other secondary aims are to evaluate tolerability of the regimens and to conduct molecular analyses to assess the presence of predictive markers of benefit and/or resistance to the study regimens This presentation is the intellectual property of the author/presenter.

Summary and Conclusions § 

Addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy and HP led to a 5.8% non statistically significant numerical increase of pCR in women with HER2+ operable breast cancer. 

§ 

An exploratory analysis shows a statistically significant higher rate of pCR (9.9%) with atezolizumab added to AC followed by HPTC compared to control HPCT, suggesting either a direct anthracycline’s effect or a mechanistic enhancement of AC with atezolizumab 

§ 

Atezolizumab did not cause major tolerability issues 

§ 

The study continues follow up until analysis of the primary endpoint of EFS
