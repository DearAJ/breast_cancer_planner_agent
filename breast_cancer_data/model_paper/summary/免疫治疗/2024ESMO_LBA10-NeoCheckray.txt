Neo-CheckRay Trial Funding Neo-CheckRay is an investigator initiated academic trial sponsored by the Jules Bordet Institute with support by AstraZeneca and drug supply for oleclumab and durvalumab provided by AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca has no role in the design of the study, in the collection, analysis and interpretation of the data, and in the writing of the abstract, manuscript or presentation. The MammaPrint® testing was conducted with support from Agendia.

Background Early-Stage Luminal B Breast Cancer (highly proliferative ER+/HER2-) • High risk luminal B breast cancer (BC): • Defined by higher stage, higher grade, high-risk genomic assays and younger age • Benefits from (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy • Pathological complete response (pCR) rates after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT): 15% • Luminal B BC is an immune “cold” tumor (unlike TNBC): • ↓TILs (tumor invading lymphocytes) • ↓PD-L1 expression • PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors added to NACT increase pCR rate: • Overall absolute ↑ pCR Δ 9% (15% → 24%) 1,2 • PD-L1 negative subgroup ↑ pCR Δ 4% (3% → 7% 1 & 10% → 14% 2) • Event free survival is awaited • Could new immunotherapy combination strategies further increase pCR% and provide long term benefit in luminal B BC? 1 Cardoso F, Keynote-756, Ann.

Background: can radiation therapy stimulate the immune response? Optimal RT+ICB combination: - Neo-adjuvant and RT in 3-5 fractions - RT only targets the primary cancer - RT spares the draining lymph nodes

Summary and conclusions NEO-CHECKRAY trial in early luminal B BC: • First phase II trial investigating the addition to immuno-chemo of: 

• iSBRT 3x8Gy to the primary tumor to induce an immune response • Anti-CD73 (oleclumab) to decrease the production of immunosuppressive adenosine • The trial demonstrated promising activity at surgery of the novel treatment combination which will need to be further validated in larger trials • The benefit iSBRT and immunotherapy combination is more pronounced in patients with PD-L1<1% • The novel treatment combinations were safe and feasible. • Extensive ongoing translational research, including on-treatment biopsies one week after iSBRT, aims to better understand mechanisms of response and the contribution of oleclumab. 16
