Background: IMpassion031 met its primary objective, signiﬁcantly improving pathological complete response (pCR) rate with atezo added to neoadjuvant CT in pts with eTNBC (58% vs 41% with CT alone in the intent-to-treat [ITT] population; 17% difference, 1-sided p¼0.0044) [Mittendorf 2020]. Beneﬁt from atezo was seen regardless of PD-L1 status. Methods: Pts with untreated stage II/III eTNBC and a primary tumour >2 cm were randomised 1:1 to placebo or atezo 840 mg q2w + neoadjuvant CT (nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 qw for 12 wk, then doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 q2w for 8 wk). After surgery, pts randomised to atezo received open-label atezo 1200 mg q3w for 11 cycles. Pts without pCR could have standard adjuvant systemic therapy ( atezo). Stratiﬁcation factors were disease stage (II vs III) and PD-L1 status (IC <1% vs 1% by SP142). Secondary efﬁcacy endpoints included event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the ITT and PD-L1+ populations. Results: After w39 mos’ median follow-up, EFS, DFS and OS numerically favoured atezo consistently across key clinical subgroups (Table). Among pts without pCR, 14/ 70 (20%) in the atezo arm vs 33/99 (33%) in the placebo arm received additional adjuvant systemic therapy, most often capecitabine (4/70 [6%] vs 26/99 [26%]). In exploratory analyses, pCR was highly prognostic for long-term outcome. Exploratory ctDNA analyses showed clearance in most pts (including all ctDNA-evaluable pts with pCR) at surgery. Positive ctDNA at/after surgery was associated with poor prognosis. There were no new safety signals or treatment-related deaths with atezo. 

Conclusions: The signiﬁcant pCR beneﬁt with the addition of atezo to CT for eTNBC translated into numerically improved EFS, DFS and OS. Long-term safety results are consistent with previous reports.
