Introduction PD1-blockade added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the new standard of care for early triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients1-4 • 

Improved event-free survival with 9% at 5 years5, OS 4.9% at 5 years6. 

• 

Substantial toxicity with 4 chemotherapy agents plus PD1-blockade 

• 

TNBC patients with high level of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have excellent survival7,8 even without chemo9,10 

• 

Other solid tumors: Combination checkpoint inhibition showed favorable outcome compared to anti-PD1 monotherapy11, 12 1. Schmid et al. NEJM 2022 2. Mittendorf et al. Lancet 2020, 3. Loibl et al. Ann Oncol 2022 4. Gianni et al. Ann Oncol 2022

Conclusion and discussion Our exploratory results suggest: • Promising pCR rate (33% for nivo/ipi, 47% with nivo/rela) with only 6-8 wks of combination ICI in TIL high TNBC. Both cohorts met threshold to expand to stage II • High rate of IR-AEs especially regarding endocrinopathies and especially with nivo/low dose ipi Future research is needed regarding: • QoL after ICI mainly affected by long-term IR-AEs (adrenal gland problems) vs QoL after chemo with long-term PNP, fertility, cardiac, fatigue issues • Is a pCR after ICI alone as good as a pCR after chemo? • Why do some tumors not respond to ICI despite very high TILs?
