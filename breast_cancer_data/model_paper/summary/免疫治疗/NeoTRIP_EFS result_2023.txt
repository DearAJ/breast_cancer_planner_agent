Background: In NeoTRIP (NCT002620280) addition of atezolizumab to nab-paclitaxel/ carboplatin was linked to minor numerical increase of pathologic complete response (pCR) in women with high-risk TNBC (48.6 vs 44.4%, p ¼ 0.48), which was 7.6% higher in PD-L1 positive tumors treated with atezolizumab (Gianni L et al, Annal Oncol 2022). Methods: In the phase III open label NeoTRIP study 280 patients with early high-risk or locally advanced TNBC were randomized to neoadjuvant carboplatin AUC 2 and nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 iv on d1,8 q3 wks with (138) or w/o (142) atezolizumab 1200 mg iv on d1, for 8 cycles followed by surgery and by 4 cycles of an anthracycline regimen regardless of pCR. The primary endpoint of the study is EFS, deﬁned as time from date of randomization to date of disease progression while on primary therapy, or disease recurrence after surgery or death due to any cause. Results: At median follow-up of 54 months, the ﬁve-year EFS was 70.6% (95% CI 61.6 e 77.9) with atezolizumab and 74.9% (95% CI 66.6 e 81.5) w/o atezolizumab. The stratiﬁed analysis (by disease stage, PD-L1, age class) resulted in a p-value ¼ 0.66. The table shows the impact of the stratiﬁcation factors and pCR on EFS evaluated by a multivariate Cox model. Higher baseline stromal TILs were prognostic of better EFS in each arm, but they were not predictive of atezolizumab beneﬁt. No new safety signals possibly related to atezolizumab emerged during follow up. Table: LBA19 Variable

Conclusions: In NeoTRIP the addition of neoadjuvant atezolizumab to carboplatin/nabpaclitaxel did not improve EFS of patients with TNBC. PD-L1 expression and higher sTILs at baseline were prognostic for better EFS, but not predictive of atezolizumab beneﬁt. Extensive biomarkers analysis by Image Mass Cytometry (Wang XQ et al, Nature 2023), RNAseq and WES are ongoing to identify those cases who can derive beneﬁt from atezolizumab.

Conclusions: CM-7FL met its primary endpoint with signiﬁcantly improved pCR and RCB 0e1 rates (enhanced in PD-L1+ pts) with NIVO + NACT, with increased IMAE incidence and an overall safety proﬁle consistent with that of NIVO and CT.

Background: High-risk, early-stage ER+ HER2 BC treatment includes NACT and adjuvant ET. CheckMate 7FL (CM-7FL; NCT04109066) is the ﬁrst prospective, phase 3, randomized trial investigating NIVO + NACT + adjuvant ET in this clinical setting. Methods: This study enrolled newly diagnosed ER+ HER2 BC pts, stages T1ce2 and N1e2 or T3e4 and N0e2, of grade 2 (ER 1e10%) or 3 (ER  1%). Pts were randomized 1:1 to NACT + NIVO 360 mg Q3W/NIVO 240 mg Q2W (arm A) or NACT + PBO (arm B). In April 2022, based on external data, the trial was closed to new enrollment; the primary endpoint was amended to only pathological complete response (pCR; ypT0/is ypN0) rate in the modiﬁed ITT population (mITTP; database lock 14 Apr 2023). Secondary endpoints included pCR rates in programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)positive (PD-L1+) pts (SP142  1%), residual cancer burden (RCB) 0e1 rates (all pts and PD-L1+), adverse event (AE) incidences, and death incidences. Results: 830 pts were screened, 521 randomized (arm A/B, n ¼ 263/258), and 510 were included in the mITTP. Baseline characteristics were balanced across arms. pCR rate was overall signiﬁcantly higher in arm A (24.5%) vs B (13.8%; P ¼ 0.0021) and in the stage III subgroup (Arm A/B, 30.7%/8.1%). The beneﬁt of NIVO on pCR was higher in PD-L1+ pts (adjusted difference [AD], 24.1%; 44.3% in arm A, 20.2% in arm B). RCB 0e1 rates improved overall and more so in PD-L1+ pts. In the NACT phase, grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs incidence was similar across arms (arm A/B, n ¼ 92[35%]/82 [32%]). Two deaths (pneumonitis, hepatitis) in arm A were study-drug related. Immune-mediated AE (IMAE) incidence was higher in arm A vs B.
