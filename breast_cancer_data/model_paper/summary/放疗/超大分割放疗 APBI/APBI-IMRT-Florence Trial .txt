Accelerated Partial-Breast Irradiation Compared With Whole-Breast Irradiation for Early Breast Cancer: Long-Term Results of the Randomized Phase III APBI-IMRT-Florence Trial 

PURPOSE To report the long-term results of external-beam accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT) Florence phase III trial comparing whole-breast irradiation (WBI) to APBI in early-stage breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS The primary end point was to determine the 5-year difference in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) between 30 Gy in 5 once-daily fractions (APBI arm) and 50 Gy in 25 fractions with a tumor bed boost (WBI arm) after breast-conserving surgery. 

RESULTS Five hundred twenty patients, more than 90% of whom had characteristics associated with low recurrence risk, were randomly assigned (WBI, n 5 260; APBI, n 5 260) between 2005 and 2013. Median follow-up was 10.7 years. The 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR was 2.5% (n 5 6) in the WBI and 3.7% (n 5 9) in the APBI arm (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; 95% CI, 0.55 to 4.37; P 5 .40). Overall survival at 10 years was 91.9% in both arms (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.79; P 5 .86). Breast cancer–speciﬁc survival at 10 years was 96.7% in the WBI and 97.8% in the APBI arm (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.99; P 5 .45). The APBI arm showed signiﬁcantly less acute toxicity (P 5 .0001) and late toxicity (P 5 .0001) and improved cosmetic outcome as evaluated by both physician (P 5 .0001) and patient (P 5 .0001). CONCLUSION The 10-year cumulative IBTR incidence in early breast cancer treated with external APBI using IMRT technique in 5 once-daily fractions is low and not different from that after WBI. Acute and late treatmentrelated toxicity and cosmesis outcomes were signiﬁcantly in favor of APBI. J Clin Oncol 38:4175-4183. © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

Breast-conserving therapy has been established as the preferred treatment option for most early-stage breast cancer (BC). Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) plus radiation therapy (RT) obtains at least the same results in terms of survival, without the huge impact on the patient’s body image and health-related quality of life, as that seen after mastectomy.1,2 For decades, conventionally fractionated whole-breast irradiation (WBI) consisted of 45-50 Gy over 4.5-5 weeks with or without a surgical bed boost dose.3,4 Large phase III trials evaluating different hypofractionation schedules proved that overall treatment time could be reduced using hypofractionated WBI, without compromising local control and warranting a good safety proﬁle.5,6 Partial-breast irradiation (PBI) has been introduced as an alternative treatment approach for selected patients with early BC. Estimated advantages of PBI 

as compared with WBI included shorter overall treatment time when accelerated (APBI), improved adverse events proﬁle, and cost reduction.7 Several large phase III trials demonstrated the noninferiority of PBI versus WBI in terms of local recurrence (LR) and similar or reduced toxicity at 5 years.8-11 However, the optimal schedule to obtain the best balance between local control and toxicity still represents a challenge because of some conﬂicting results.11,12 Our singlecenter University of Florence phase III APBI trial using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) showed no signiﬁcant difference between APBI and WBI in terms of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and survival rates at 5 years, with signiﬁcantly improved outcomes in terms of treatment-related toxicity and cosmetic results in favor of the APBI arm.13 We hereby present the long-term results at a median follow-up of 10 years.

CONTEXT Key Objective To assess whether accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) is a safe and effective alternative treatment as compared to whole-breast irradiation (WBI) for selected patients with early breast cancer (BC). Knowledge Generated The 10-year cumulative disease control failure incidence in patients treated with APBI was low and not signiﬁcantly different from patients treated with WBI, in the face of a treatment-related toxicity and cosmesis outcomes signiﬁcantly in favor of the APBI arm. Relevance APBI approach using an intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique in 5 once-daily fractions should be considered an attractive option when an external APBI approach is chosen to treat a patient with low-risk early BC. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS Study Population We performed this randomized phase III single-center clinical trial between March 2005 and June 2013 at the Radiation Oncology Unit of the University of Florence (Florence, Italy). The study aimed to compare tangential ﬁelds conventionally fractionated WBI and APBI using IMRT technique. Eligible patients, as previously reported, were women age . 40 years with early BC (maximum 

diameter, 2.5 cm) suitable for BCS.13 Extensive intraductal carcinoma, multiple foci cancer, and ﬁnal surgical margins , 5 mm represented the main exclusion criteria. The local ethics committee (Azienda Ospedaliero–Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy) gave permission to perform the current study, which was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All patients provided full written informed consent. The CONSORT diagram and trial proﬁle are summarized in Figure 1.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either WBI or APBI using IMRT in a 1:1 ratio. Allocation was performed with a computer-generated sequence using a randomly permuted block design, without any stratiﬁcation of main prognostic factors. The random sequence was kept by an external center (local Oncological Centre for Departmental Reference). Clinicians, investigators, and the patients themselves were aware of the arm assignment. No stratiﬁcation factors were planned in the randomization process. The surgeons were requested to place clips at the borders of the surgical bed, using a minimum of 4 clips. Computed tomography scanning was performed using 0.3-cm-thick slices and was performed within 4 weeks after surgery. Patients treated with conventionally fractionated WBI received a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, followed by an RT boost on the surgical bed of 10 Gy in 5 fractions. Dose was delivered with wedged photon tangential ﬁelds, and boost was treated with an electron direct ﬁeld. The organs at risk (OARs) constraints were that 5% of the heart and 20% of the lung were kept to , 20 Gy. Homogeneity of the dose to the target was controlled by keeping the maximum dose within 55 Gy and the volume receiving more than 52.5 Gy (V52.5) , 10%. In patients assigned to the APBI arm, the clinical target volume (CTV) was drawn with a uniform 1-cm 3dimensional margin around the surgical clips; the CTV was limited to 3 mm from the skin surface. A second uniform 3-dimensional 1-cm margin was added to the CTV to obtain the planning target volume (PTV). The PTV was allowed to extend 4 mm inside the ipsilateral lung and was limited to 3 mm from the skin. The ipsilateral and contralateral breast, ipsilateral and contralateral lung, and the heart and spinal cord were contoured as OARs. Five (6 MV) step-and-shoot IMRT coplanar ﬁelds were used. A dose of 30 Gy in 5 nonconsecutive once-daily fractions was prescribed. Using the linear quadratic model and assuming an a/b ratio of 3, this prescription was equivalent to 54 Gy in a standard 2-Gy fractionation. If the a/b ratio is assumed to be 2, the equivalent dose in standard fractionation will be 60 Gy. The every-other-day approach was chosen to be cautious in relation to the toxicity proﬁle and was believed to be not detrimental in terms of treatment efﬁcacy, considering BC a slow potential doubling time tumor.14 The following constraints were adopted for plan optimization: PTV coverage, 100% of PTV covered by 95% of the prescribed dose (V28.5 5 100%); maximal dose to PTV , 105% (31.5 Gy); minimal dose to PTV 28 Gy; uninvolved breast: not . 50% received a dose of . 50% of the prescribed dose (V15 , 50%); ipsilateral lung, not . 20% received a dose . 10 Gy (V10 , 20%); contralateral lung, not . 10% received a dose . 5 Gy (V5 , 10%); contralateral breast, maximal dose , 1 Gy; and heart, not . 10% received a dose . 3 Gy (V3 , 10%).

Dosimetric quality assurance (QA) was performed following the normal workﬂow of our institute: dose veriﬁcation for patients undergoing WBI was not performed pretreatment, because only static ﬁelds were used for planning, whereas APBI IMRT ﬁelds were veriﬁed before treatment of a subset of patients (1 out of 5). Quality assurance in radiotherapy (QART) is summarized in Appendix Table A1 (online only). Molecular subtypes were immunohistochemistry-based on local assessment, consistent with the 12th St Gallen International Expert Consensus.15 Follow-Up Adjuvant systemic treatments were prescribed following our institutional policy during the trial enrollment period. After completion of RT, we followed up all patients monthly for 3 months, every 4 months for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter. Clinical examination was performed at each follow-up visit; mammography was annually programmed, and other diagnostic examinations were requested only in case of suspect symptoms. End Points We deﬁned LR (true recurrence) as the reappearance of the BC in the index quadrant and ipsilateral breast tumors as any new BC diagnosed in other quadrants of the same breast. The sum of LR and new ipsilateral breast tumors was deﬁned as IBTR. Locoregional tumor recurrence (LRR) also included any recurrence in the ipsilateral axillary, supraclavicular or internal mammary chain nodal regions. Distant metastases (DM) were deﬁned as any recurrence to distant organs (visceral and bone sites). Treatment-related toxicity was assessed using the acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria and late radiation morbidity scoring scheme from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer.16 Cosmetic outcome was scored by both physician and patient on the 4-category Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale.17 The primary end point was the IBTR rate. The secondary end points were LRR, DM, and contralateral BC (CBC) rates, BC-speciﬁc survival (BCSS), and overall survival (OS), acute/late treatmentrelated toxicity, and cosmetic outcomes. Statistical Methods The study was designed to compare the 5-year IBTR rate in the APBI and WBI arms. Assuming a 5-year IBTR of 3% in the WBI group and equivalence of the 2 groups if occurrence of IBTR in the APBI group did not exceed 5% (accepted level in most institutions at trial design time), a sample of 245 patients per group provided an 80% statistical power. The main analysis was by intention to treat (ITT), including all randomly assigned patients. We also perform a per-protocol analysis, restricted to patients who received the allocated treatment and satisﬁed eligibility criteria, thus excluding 14 patients allocated to the APBI arm (Fig 1). Characteristics of the patients were compared

between groups with an exact Fisher test or x2 for trends, as appropriate. Survival analyses were performed in relation to speciﬁc events: IBTR, LRR, CBC, DM, and death. Time to events was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of the speciﬁc event. BCSS was deﬁned as the time from the diagnosis to time of death due to BC or last follow-up. OS was deﬁned as the time from the diagnosis to time of death or last follow-up (February 1, 2020). No loss to follow-up was found. Patients who died before experiencing a disease occurrence were considered censored at their dates of death. Event rates and their 95% CIs were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between groups of patients were evaluated using the log-rank test. A univariable Cox proportional regression model was used to obtain the hazard ratios (HRs) for IBTR and deaths for APBI versus WBI. A multivariable Cox proportional regression model was used to identify independent factors of IBTR among patients treated with APBI using the IMRT technique. All 2-sided P values , .05 were considered signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics software (version 22; SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).

Between 2005 and 2013, 520 patients were enrolled in the trial, with 260 randomly assigned to the WBI arm and 260 to the APBI arm (Fig 1). As of February 1, 2020, the whole series median time of follow-up was 10.7 years (mean, 10.5 years; standard deviation [SD], 2.6 years; range, 1.4-14.8 years). The median follow-up times of the WBI and APBI arms were 10.9 years (range, 1.4-14.7 years) and 10.5 years (range, 2.0-14.8 years), respectively. Most of patients were . 50 years old (82.7% WBI v 84.2% APBI; mean, 61.6 years; median, 62.8 years; range, 40-85 years) and had tumor grade 1-2 (87.3% WBI v 90% APBI), size , 2 cm (81.9% WBI v 85.5% APBI), with negative nodal status (81.9% WBI v 89.2% APBI) and ER-positive disease (95.8% WBI v 95.4% APBI). Although the majority of patients had luminal-like tumors (92.8% WBI v 94.9% APBI), approximately 30% of cases (10.4% ductal carcinoma in situ and 22% invasive carcinoma) did not receive any adjuvant systemic treatment (28.8% WBI v 35.8% APBI). Main enrolled population characteristics at baseline were similar in the 2 treatment arms and are summarized in Table 1.

The 10-year cumulative incidence of CBC was 3.2% (n 5 8) in the WBI arm and 0.8% (n 5 2) in the APBI arm (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.05 to 1.18; P 5 .08). Median time to CBC occurrence was 3.3 years (mean, 4.0 years; SD, 2.0 years; range, 2.5-9.3 years). The 10-year cumulative incidence of DM was 3.2% (n 5 8) in the WBI arm and 2.9% (n 5 7) in the APBI arm (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.32 to 2.47; P 5 .83), for an absolute difference of 0.3% (Fig 2C). Median time to DM occurrence was 4.1 years (mean, 5.3 years; SD, 3.2 years; range, 1.5-12.1 years). There were no signiﬁcant differences between APBI and WBI for BCSS and OS (Fig 3). There were 49 (9.4%) deaths reported (n 5 520), with 25 (9.6%) patients in the WBI arm and 24 (9.2%) in the APBI arm. The 10-year point estimate for OS was 91.9% in both arms (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.79; P 5 .86). There were 15 (2.9%) deaths due to BC (n 5 520), with 7 (2.7%) patients in the WBI arm and Journal of Clinical Oncology 

8 (3.1%) in the APBI arm. The 10-year point estimate for BCSS was 96.7% in the WBI arm and 97.8% in the APBI arm (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.99; P 5 .45). There were no signiﬁcant differences in the number of patients with second primary cancers reported between the 2 groups. There were 13 (10%) with at least 1 second primary cancer reported; the 10-year cumulative incidence of second primary tumor was 1.8% (n 5 3) in the WBI arm and 2.5% (n 5 4) in the APBI group (P 5 .70). Main analyses were repeated using the per-protocol population and showed consistent ﬁndings. At time of analysis, all patients had follow-up information available to establish survival status and to assess recurrence, disease-free, and safety end points; 92.1% of the alive patients had a minimum follow-up of 7 years. The 5-, 7-, and 10-year rates reporting main outcomes are summarized in Table 2. We did exploratory analyses in the ITT population to determine if there were any variations in treatment effects for WBI and

APBI between characteristics identiﬁed as prognostic for IBTR, including age, tumor size and grade, nodal status, hormone receptor status, and risk group. In addition, we performed an analysis in luminal-like patients (n 5 437) to further investigate the potential impact of postoperative systemic treatments (both endocrine and chemotherapy). No signiﬁcant factors emerged at univariable or multivariable analysis (Appendix Tables A2 and A3, online only). We performed an exploratory analysis stratifying patients following the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)18 and European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO)19 recommendations for PBI; we observed 4/133 IBTR (3.5% in the suitable ASTRO group) and 7/190 IBTR (4.0% in the low-risk ESTRO group) at 10 years in the APBI arm. No signiﬁcant differences between risk groups emerged in the whole series or between arms (Appendix Table A4, online only). 

Safety and Cosmesis Adverse event information was available for all patients. In the acute period, the highest toxicity grade reported from APBI was grade 1 in 47 (19.1%) and grade 2 in 5 (2%) patients. The highest toxicity reported from WBI was grade 1 in 75 (28.8%), grade 2 in 81 (31.2%), and grade 3 in 17 (6.5%) patients. In the late period, the highest toxicity grade reported from APBI was grade 1 in 11 (4.5%). The highest toxicity reported from WBI was grade 1 in 71 (27.3%) and grade 2 in 7 (2.7%) patients. The APBI arm showed signiﬁcantly improved treatment-related adverse events in both the acute (P 5 .0001) and late periods (P 5 .0001). Overall, patients reported favorable cosmetic scores in the follow-up period (excellent to good rates in approximately 90% of cases), but a higher proportion of patients undergoing WBI experienced adverse cosmesis (deﬁned as

might represent a paradigm shift toward an effective deescalation of treatment of selected hormone-sensitive early BC.20 Main evidence showed that local control of disease is closely related to an adequate selection of patients,21 whereas treatment-related toxicity and cosmetic outcomes seem to be strongly associated with the technique and schedule of choice.8-13,22 The ESTRO and the (recently updated) ASTRO recommendations identiﬁed suitable candidates for PBI outside clinical trials, and both are aligned with selecting patients . 50 years old, tumor size , 2 cm, negative nodal status, and ﬁnal surgical margins $ 2 mm.16,17 The ASTRO suitable group especially includes the ER positivity as a key selection criterion for APBI.16 The randomized trials IMPORT LOW (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT00814567; moderately hypofractionated PBI), an excellent model of adequate patient selection, and GEC-ESTRO (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT00402519; brachytherapy) demonstrated the noninferiority of PBI versus WBI for LR with similar or reduced toxicity at 5 years.8-10 The NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT00103181)— at a median follow-up of 10.2 years—showed few breast events (4.5% risk of IBTR, 3% of DM, and 2% of BC-related death rate), reporting low and comparable toxicity rates.12 Although the trial did not meet the primary end point assumptions, the authors, discussing the absolute difference of , 1% at 10-year cumulative incidence between arms, consider APBI an acceptable alternative for some women. The RAPID trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT00282035), using both 3-dimensional conformal and IMRT techniques, showed that APBI was not inferior to WBI in preventing LR, with less acute toxicity but increased late toxicity and adverse cosmesis, probably due to the twicedaily regimen and some lack of consistency in target volume deﬁnition.11 It will be of notable interest to interpret the ﬁndings from the unpublished IRMA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT01803958), which reported a comparable toxicity proﬁle between arms at a preliminary analysis,23 thus strengthening the crucial role of the incomplete recovery of normal tissue between fractions for the twice-daily treatment within the radiobiological model.24 The long-term update of our trial conﬁrmed the previously published promising ﬁndings at a 5-year median followup.13 We observed few IBTR events at a median follow-up of 10 years and an absolute cumulative difference of 1.2% at 10 years nonsigniﬁcantly in favor of the WBI arm (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.55 to 4.37; P 5 .40). Depending on the value placed on IBTR, this absolute IBTR difference between arms might be considered as not clinically relevant. Indeed, distant control of disease as well as BCSS and OS were comparable between arms. Interestingly, we observed a nonsigniﬁcant but clear trend in favor of the APBI arm in terms of CBC rate (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.05 to 1.18; P 5 .08), a ﬁnding calling for additional large-scale investigations on potentially WBI-related CBC.

Concerning treatment-related toxicity, we observed excellent results both in the acute and late periods, signiﬁcantly in favor of the once-daily APBI schedule (delivered every other day): 2% of patients undergoing APBI experienced an acute grade $ 2 toxicity (compared with 37.7% of WBI arm; P 5 .0001), and none of them experienced a late grade $ 2 toxicity (compared with 2.7% of WBI arm; P 5 .015). These outcomes might have consequently inﬂuenced the cosmesis results: we observed almost 100% excellent to good cosmetic outcomes in both arms as rated by physicians (excellent to good rate, 100% [APBI] v 98.1% [WBI]). Of note, the WBI arm showed a consistent patient-rated fair outcome of 14.6% (compared with 0.8% of the APBI arm). Future perspectives call for continue efforts to explore the best precision medicine strategy for very-low-risk patients, investigating local as well as systemic treatments deescalation.25 Several ongoing prospective phase II-III biologydriven studies (PRECISION, ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT02653755; EXPERT, TROG16.04/ANZ1601/BIG1602, ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT02889874; DBCG RT NATURAL, ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT03646955; and EUROPA, ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT04134598) aim to identify which patients are optimally suited for RT omission. To our knowledge, our study represents the only phase III trial with patients treated in a single center using a unique once-daily IMRT technique schedule and a revised QART assessment. All plans respected the QART assumptions, both in terms of target coverage and OARs thresholds constrains (Appendix Table A1). The small sample size of the series—representing the main limitation of our study— was based on statistical assumptions considered acceptable at the time of study design but not sufﬁcient to demonstrate

the noninferiority of the APBI arm. However, we do believe that no other local control/survival data are needed to conﬁrm that an external PBI is a valid approach to treat a consistent rate of low-risk patients after BCS, because the main published studies converge on this message.8,9,11,12 Our ﬁndings add valuable knowledge regarding the choice of the best radiation technique and schedule to prevent adverse toxicity/cosmesis.22 It is worth mentioning that the RT treatment received by the control arm could be considered out of date by today’s standards. Currently, most patients having the characteristics of our series would be treated with moderate hypofractionation WBI without boost,5 which may result in a better cosmetic outcome compared with conventionally fractionated WBI. Moreover, tangential wedged ﬁelds tend to produce dose distributions with inferior homogeneity compared with modern ﬁeld-in-ﬁeld or IMRT techniques, and the lack of homogeneity could also have affected cosmesis. Although these considerations must be taken into account when comparing toxicity between the 2 groups, the toxicity rates of the APBI arm are undoubtedly low. In summary, the 10-year cumulative IBTR incidence in early BC treated with an external APBI approach using IMRT technique in 5 once-daily nonconsecutive fractions was low and not signiﬁcantly different from that of patients treated with conventionally fractionated WBI. Comparable LRR, DM, BCSS, and OS rates were observed, in the face of an acute and late treatment-related toxicity and cosmesis outcomes signiﬁcantly in favor of the APBI arm. Therefore, this schedule should be considered an attractive option when an external APBI approach is chosen to treat a patient with low-risk early BC.
