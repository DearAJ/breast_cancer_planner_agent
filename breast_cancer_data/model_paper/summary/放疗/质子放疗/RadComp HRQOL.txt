Abstract Purpose: Our purpose was to evaluate the measurement properties of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures used in the ongoing RadComp pragmatic randomized clinical trial (PRCT). 

Author Manuscript 

Methods and Materials: The deidentified and blinded data set included 774 English-speaking female participants who completed their 6-month posttreatment assessment. Eleven PRO measures were evaluated, including the Trial Outcome Index from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes, the BREAST-Q, and selected Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. PROs were measured at 3 timepoints: baseline, completion of radiation therapy (RT), and 6 months post-RT. Ten variables were used as validity anchors. Pearson or Spearman correlations were calculated between PROs and convergent validity indicators. Mean PRO differences between clinically distinct categories were compared with analysis of variance methods (known-groups validity). PRO change scores were mapped to change in other variables (sensitivity to change). Results: Most correlations between PROs and validity indicators were large (≥0.5). Mean score for Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes was higher (better) for those with a lumpectomy compared with those with a mastectomy (P < .001). Mean scores for the FACT-B Trial Outcome Index and for PROMIS Fatigue and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities were

better for those with good baseline performance status compared with those with poorer baseline performance status (P < .05). At completion of RT and post-RT, mean scores for Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes and BREAST-Q Radiation were significantly different (P < .001) across categories for all Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Treatment Satisfaction − General items. There were medium-sized correlations between change scores for FACT-B Trial Outcome Index, Fatigue, Anxiety, and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and change scores in the Visual Analog Scale. Conclusions: For patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer receiving radiation in the RadComp PRCT, our findings demonstrate high reliability and validity for important PRO measures, supporting their psychometric strength and usefulness to reflect the effect of RT on health-related quality of life. 

Author Manuscript 

Introduction Longitudinal assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including health-related quality of life (HRQL), is important to understanding patients’ treatment experiences, unmet needs, and therapeutic outcomes. Treatment side effects can adversely affect multiple domains of HRQL.1 This effect can be long-lasting after initial treatment. HRQL is essential to consider in the treatment decision-making process and must be assessed by both patients and provider(s). 

Author Manuscript 

Radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to have an effect on HRQL in women with breast cancer, and other radiation treatment side effects have also been shown to negatively affect HRQL during and after RT. In 1 study, breast reconstructive surgery plus RT was associated with worse HRQL compared with surgery alone.2 Among 633 patients followed for more than 3 years, those who received radiation reported lower psychosocial, physical, and sexual well-being, as well as less satisfaction with breast cosmesis and overall outcome. Study results indicated a negative effect of RT on participant satisfaction with their breast after reconstruction.2 These results are important, as body image has been associated with worse HRQL and increased rates of depression.3 Moreover, radiation fractionation is associated with differing profiles of HRQL impairment.4 

Author Manuscript 

The Pragmatic Randomized Trial of Proton Versus Photon Therapy for Patients With Non-Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Radiotherapy Comparative Effectiveness (RadComp) Consortium Trial (NCT02603341)5 is a large scale, multicenter pragmatic randomized clinical trial following patients longitudinally for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, HRQL, and cancer control outcomes. Because HRQL is an important factor in patient experience and is affected by RT, a secondary aim of RadComp is to assess the effectiveness of proton versus photon therapy in improving physical, mental, and social HRQL; specifically, body image and function in breast cancer, and fatigue, anxiety, social roles, general HRQL, side effects burden, and satisfaction. However, despite the use of PRO measures to evaluate HRQL for patients with cancer generally and breast cancer specifically, there has been limited research to assess the reliability and validity6–9 of PRO measures for subpopulations of patients receiving various cancer treatments.

relies on the psychometric strength of its performance in the target population.6–8 Reliability refers to the extent to which a scale or measure yields reproducible and consistent results. Validity refers to the extent to which the scale or measure reflects what it is intended to measure (rather than something else). Limited research on the reliability and validity of PRO measures is a particular gap for patients with breast cancer who require more extensive treatment to the breast/chest wall and comprehensive nodal irradiation after lumpectomy or mastectomy. This is estimated to include about a third of breast cancer cases diagnosed annually, or roughly 88,000 individuals of the 268,000 individuals diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2019. Comprehensive regional or nodal irradiation involves the treatment of those lymph node basins at risk for breast cancer spread, including the axillary nodes (underneath the armpit), the supraclavicular nodes (above the clavicle), and the internal mammary lymph nodes (lateral to the sternum in the first 3 intercostal spaces). 

Author Manuscript 

The purpose of this present analysis was to evaluate the measurement properties7,10 of several PRO measures using data drawn from the ongoing RadComp trial to contribute to the larger HRQL literature and lay the foundation for subsequent forthcoming comparative studies of proton and photon therapy in RadComp and for future studies. 

Methods and Materials Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine institutional review board and the institutional review boards or research ethics boards of 32 participating United States (US) institutions. Sample 

Author Manuscript 

Beginning in April 2016, adult patients (age ≥21 years) with nonmetastatic breast cancer were enrolled on the RadComp clinical trial at multiple sites in the US.5 RadComp eligibility criteria are defined broadly to maximize generalizability of results (Table E1). Participants are enrolled after undergoing surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) with or without chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and before starting RT. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either photon or proton therapy to a radiation dose of 45.0 Gy relative biological effectiveness (RBE) to 50.4 Gy(RBE) in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy(RBE) fractions with or without a tumor bed boost. All participants receive breast/chest wall and comprehensive nodal RT, including internal mammary node treatment. The trial was approved by central and, as necessary, local institutional review boards. Participants provided written informed consent. This secondary analysis is a deidentified and blinded sample of English-speaking female participants who completed their 6-month post-treatment HRQL assessment as of January 3, 2022. Only English-speaking female participants were included in this analysis because there were so few Spanish-speaking only or male participants in the trial.

Procedures Details of the trial design, outcomes, and treatment procedures for each arm have previously been reported.5 Participants completed a set of PRO instruments by self-administration on paper or through an online portal before starting RT (baseline), at the completion of RT,

and 6 months postcompletion of RT. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected by study coordinators via in-person/telephone interviews and from medical records. Reasons for missing PRO instruments were documented by study coordinators for each timepoint. PRO measures 

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript 

This analysis evaluated the measurement properties of 11 PRO measures that were selected as HRQL endpoints for the trial; a list of additional PRO measures in the trial is available from the authors. (1) The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast plus 6 additional items targeting lymphedema (FACT-B+6)11,12 includes 44 items assessing multiple HRQOL domains. Thirty of these items were combined to form a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) capturing physical and functional well-being, breast cancer-specific concerns, arm mobility, pain, and swelling. Higher scores (range, 0–120) represent better HRQL. (2) Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes is a 6-item scale that provides a brief assessment of patientreported cosmetic outcomes after breast cancer treatment.13 Higher scores (range, 1–5) represent more satisfaction. (3) The BREAST-Q measures the patient’s perspective on the effect of breast surgery.14 A 5-item subscale to assess adverse effects of RT was used in this trial. Higher scores (range, 0–100) represent less bother. (4) The 4-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue short form assesses patient perceptions of fatigue and its consequences.15–17 PROMIS scores are reported as T-scores (mean = 50, SD = 10), standardized to the US general population; higher scores represent more fatigue. (5) The 4-item PROMIS Anxiety short form assesses self-reported fearfulness, anxious worry, and tension.18,19 PROMIS scores are reported as T-scores (mean = 50, SD = 10), with higher scores representing more anxiety. (6) The 4-item PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities short form assesses participation in activities with others and carrying out one’s usual roles and responsibilities; higher T-scores (mean = 50, SD = 10) represent better social participation.20 (7–11) Two items evaluating the severity of, and interference with, daily activities caused by shortness of breath were captured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) measurement system, which was developed by the National Cancer Institute to permit patient self-reporting of symptomatic adverse events in cancer clinical trials.21 With the developers’ permission, 3 items were created to evaluate in the past 7 days the frequency, severity, and the degree of interference associated with chest pain, chest tightness, or angina. For this trial using the PRO-CTCAE format, PROs were measured at all 3 timepoints except for BREAST-Q, which was only measured at 2 timepoints (completion of RT and 6 months postcompletion of RT). Validity anchor indicators 

Author Manuscript 

Ten variables were identified as validity anchors (variables that categorize patients into clinically distinct groups) based on recommended methods including a literature review, clinical judgment, and conceptual relatedness.7 (1) The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from the EQ-5D-5L is a measure of the patient’s current health state, ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).22 The VAS was used as the anchor for validity analyses for these outcomes: Trial Outcome Index, Fatigue, Anxiety, and Ability to Participate. (2) Productivity assesses the extent that a patient was able to resume normal activities inside and outside the home, and at work, if employed, using an 11-category Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys.

scale ranging from 0% to 100%.23 Productivity was used for validity analyses for the PRO-CTCAE items. (3) The 2 types of surgical procedures for breast cancer are classified as breast-conserving (lumpectomy) or radical (mastectomy). Surgery type was used for validity analyses for Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes. (4) Zubrod Performance Status is a clinician-rated estimate of the patient’s ability to perform activities of daily living without the help of others, ranging from 0 (fully functional and asymptomatic) to 4 (bedridden).24 Performance status was used for validity analyses for these outcomes: Trial Outcome Index, Fatigue, Anxiety, Ability to Participate, and PRO-CTCAE. (5–10) The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Treatment Satisfaction − General (FACIT-TS-G) measures general satisfaction with treatment.25 Six of its 8 items were used in this trial. The FACIT-TS-G was used for validity analyses for these outcomes: Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes and BREAST-Q. VAS and productivity were measured at all 3 timepoints, surgical procedure and performance status were measured only at baseline, and FACIT-TS-G was measured at 2 timepoints (completion of RT and 6-months postcompletion of RT). Statistical methods 

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript 

All PROs were scored according to published guidelines. Cronbach’s coefficient a was used to estimate internal consistency reliability for multi-item aggregated scales (an indicator of how well items in a multi-item scale measure the same thing); values ≥0.70 are considered the standard for group-level applications, and values ≥0.90 are considered the standard for individual-level applications.6 Pearson or Spearman correlations were calculated between the PROs and indicators of convergent validity (the extent to which the measure was associated with measures of similar traits). Cohen’s guidelines were used to interpret the strength of the correlations: 0.1 is small, 0.3 is medium, and 0.5 is large.26 For known-groups validity analyses (how well the measure distinguished between groups that are expected to differ), mean score differences between clinically distinct categories were compared with analysis of variance methods. The Tukey-Kramer method was used to adjust P values for pairwise comparisons when there were more than 2 groups to be compared, and the overall P value was < .05.27,28 To evaluate PRO measures’ sensitivity to change (responsiveness), PRO change scores were mapped to change in other variables.29 Two sets of change scores were calculated: the difference between baseline and completion of RT and the difference between completion of RT and 6- months postcompletion of RT. Three independent groups were formed for change in productivity (better, no change, worse), that is, an increase (or decrease) of at least 1 category was considered better (or worse). When we encountered missingness in scoring multi-item scales, developer’s guidelines were used (eg, assign mean of completed items as score for missing items). We also used pairwise deletion, also known as “available case analysis,” in separate analyses to handle missing data. Two-sided significance levels were reported for statistical tests, with a nominal P < .05. All analyses were implemented with SAS/STAT software, version 9.4, of the SAS System for Windows.30

Results Participant characteristics and PROs Table 1 summarizes sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the 774 female participants included in this report; there were no missing data for these characteristics. Participant mean age was 52 years. A majority of respondents had undergone mastectomy (70%) and were non-Hispanic White (65%). In addition, 67% reported a normal activity level, and 82% reported 2 or fewer cardiovascular risk factors. 

Author Manuscript 

Descriptive statistics for the PRO outcome measures at each timepoint are summarized in Table 2. In terms of missing data, a larger proportion of participants did not complete PRO measures at the completion of RT, compared with the respondent proportions at baseline and 6- months postcompletion of RT. Only 25 to 32 participants declined to complete measures at the end of RT; the remaining reasons for missing data are considered uninformative.31 For example, participant unable to be contacted, administrative error, or unknown. Internal consistency reliability estimates for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Trial Outcome Index (FACT-TOI) were 0.88, 0.88, and 0.89 at baseline, end of RT, and post-RT; 0.91, 0.90, and 0.92 for Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes; and 0.84 and 0.79 for BREAST-Q at the end of RT and post-RT. Correlations between the PROs and 2 indicators of convergent validity (VAS and productivity) are shown in Table 3. Most correlations with the VAS were large (≥0.5). Correlations between the PRO-CTCAE items and productivity were small to medium. 

Author Manuscript 

Known-groups validity analyses at baseline are shown in Table 4. The mean score for Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes was higher (better) for those with a lumpectomy compared with those with a mastectomy (P < .001). The mean scores for the FACT-B Trial Outcome Index and for PROMIS Fatigue and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities were better for those with good baseline performance status (normal activity) compared with those with poorer baseline performance status (symptomatic and ambulatory; P < .05). Three chest pain PRO-CTCAE-like items did not differ by performance status, and 2 shortness of breath items showed small differences. Known-groups validity analyses postbaseline are shown in Table 5. At both timepoints (completion of RT and 6-months after completion of RT), mean scores for Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes and BREAST-Q Radiation were significantly different (P < .001) across categories for all FACIT-TS-G items. Mean scores also exhibited an ordinal pattern, that is, mean scores increased (improved) as FACIT-TS-G item responses improved. 

Author Manuscript 

Sensitivity to change (responsiveness) analyses are shown in Tables 6, 7 and 8. Mediumsized correlations were observed between change scores for FACT-B Trial Outcome Index, Fatigue, Anxiety, and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities and change scores in the VAS at both timepoints, and correlations were in the expected directions; for example, improvement in the FACT-B-TOI was positively associated with improvement in the VAS, and increased (worsened) fatigue was negatively associated with improvement in the VAS (Table 6). Small correlations were observed between change scores for Satisfaction with

Breast Cosmetic Outcomes and BREAST-Q Radiation and change scores in FACIT-TS-G items (Table 7). Mean change scores for the FACT-B Trial Outcome Index differed in the expected direction across change in productivity (P < .001), that is, persons with improved (better) productivity also had improved FACT-B TOI, and those with decreased (worse) productivity had lower (worse) FACT-B TOI (Table 8). 

Discussion 

Author Manuscript 

Among female participants with nonmetastatic breast cancer receiving breast or chest wall plus comprehensive nodal irradiation in the RadComp trial, there was convincing evidence for the reliability and validity of 6 PRO measures covering HRQL endpoints such as the FACT-B TOI (physical and functional well-being, breast cancer-specific concerns), body image and function, fatigue, anxiety, and ability to participate in social roles. Five single PRO-CTCAE or PRO-CTCAE-like symptom items assessing shortness of breath and chest pain, tightness, or angina showed mixed validity results. Because this is the first time these PRO-CTCAE-like items have been used, additional research will be needed. 

Author Manuscript 

The hallmark of a questionnaire’s validity is that it measures what it intends to measure. Validity accrues over time and experience with different populations. The PRO instruments we evaluated here performed as predicted when referenced to the preselected anchors. These findings are therefore consistent with prior validity evidence and extend that evidence to populations with breast cancer, including patients receiving radiation and specifically undergoing comprehensive nodal irradiation (all participants in the RadComp trial receive comprehensive nodal irradiation). Among general populations with breast cancer, the FACTB has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of HRQL. A 2015 study compared the FACT-B to another commonly used measure of quality of life for those with breast cancer, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-BR23,32 and found that while differently organized, they were similarly effective in assessing breast cancer-specific HRQL.33 The FACT-B is relevant for clinical samples and was recently used in a prospective observational study to assess HRQL for patients engaged in early RT treatment of breast cancer.34 The current findings in the RadComp trial extend the strength of the FACT-B to patients receiving breast or chest wall plus comprehensive nodal irradiation by showing that the FACT-B Trial Outcome Index met standards for good internal consistency reliability, demonstrated large correlations with convergent validity indicators (VAS and productivity), was associated with performance status (known groups validity), and demonstrated sensitivity to change in the VAS and productivity measures. 

Author Manuscript 

A previous study with the Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes measure showed that satisfaction was slightly lower (worse) in patients receiving mastectomy alone than in those who received breast conservation.13 Results from the RadComp trial showed similar findings, with lower scores for those with a mastectomy compared with those with a lumpectomy (known groups validity). RadComp trial findings also demonstrated that the satisfaction measure was associated with FACIT-TS-G treatment satisfaction at completion of RT and 6 months later (known groups validity). Change scores in the satisfaction measure and the FACIT-TS-G showed small positive correlations (<0.22; sensitivity to change).

Overall, these findings support the use of the satisfaction measure in women postsurgery and chemotherapy. 

Author Manuscript 

In prior studies, the BREAST-Q demonstrated reliability and validity among patients undergoing breast cancer surgery and other treatments.35,36 Results from the RadComp trial demonstrated that the BREAST-Q was associated with FACIT-TS-G treatment satisfaction at completion of RT and 6 months later (known groups validity). Change scores in the BREAST-Q and the FACIT-TS-G showed small positive correlations (<0.25; sensitivity to change). This research extends the strength of the BREAST-Q for patients receiving breast or chest wall plus comprehensive nodal irradiation. Assessing physical, mental, and social well-being has important clinical and scientific implications for patients with cancer. Three generic measures from PROMIS18 were used in the RadComp trial: fatigue, anxiety, and ability to participate in social roles and activities.37 Fatigue is defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that decreases one’s ability to carry out daily activities, including the ability to work effectively and to function at one’s usual level in family or social roles.38 Anxiety is a common concern among patients with cancer39 and is meaningful for patients undergoing RT. A recent study demonstrated the validity of several PROMIS measures, including fatigue and anxiety, among a diverse community-based sample of individuals with cancer.40 Fatigue and anxiety PROMIS measures also demonstrated strong ecological validity among patients with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy.41 Social health has historically been a relatively neglected domain because of the lack of objective measures for clinical populations as well as debate as to how best to define and measure it.37 

Author Manuscript 

The current findings in the RadComp trial extend the strength of the generic PROMIS measures to patients receiving breast or chest wall plus comprehensive nodal irradiation by showing that PROMIS fatigue, anxiety, and ability to participate in social roles and activities met standards for good internal consistency, reliability, and demonstrated validity in most analyses. All 3 PROMIS measures had large correlations with the VAS (convergent validity). Fatigue and ability to participate in social roles and activities were associated with performance status (known groups validity) and demonstrated sensitivity to change in the VAS. Results for anxiety showed small associations with performance status and change in the VAS. PROMIS measures could be useful for patients with cancer, their caregivers, and their clinicians to interpret the meaning of their PROMIS scores in relation to the general population, that is, PROMIS may help to monitor a return to normalcy in everyday life.

The PRO-CTCAE item library consists of 78 symptomatic adverse events represented by 124 distinct items.21 In a validation study among adults with cancer who were undergoing radiation, chemotherapy, or both, PRO-CTCAE items demonstrated generally acceptable measurement properties, including convergent validity, known groups validity, test-rest reliability, and responsiveness.42 There was content validity for 78 symptomatic toxicity items among a sample of patients undergoing radiation treatment for various types of cancer, with approximately one-third of the sample receiving radiation to the breast region.43 For the RadComp trial, 3 new items were developed to evaluate the frequency, severity, and interference caused by chest pain, chest tightness, or angina. Correlations between the PRO-CTCAE items for shortness of breath and the PRO-CTCAE-like items evaluating chest

pain and productivity were small to medium (convergent validity). Scores on these 3 chest pain PRO-CTCAE-like items did not differ by performance status, while the 2 shortness of breath items from the PRO-CTCAE item library demonstrated small differences (known groups validity). Indicators to assess sensitivity to change were not available for this study. 

Author Manuscript 

Reliability and validity are essential aspects of the measurement properties of a PRO measure; the more evidence about the psychometric strength of an instrument, the greater confidence clinicians and researchers can have in the interpretability of these measures as reflections of the burden of disease and treatment experiences of a specific patient population. Overall, in this study of women with nonmetastatic breast cancer undergoing breast or chest wall plus comprehensive nodal irradiation, results demonstrated evidence for the reliability and validity of 6 PRO measures (FACT-B TOI, Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcomes, BREAST-Q Radiation module, PROMIS Fatigue, PROMIS Anxiety, and PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles). Five PRO-CTCAE items assessing shortness of breath and chest pain showed mixed validity results. Thus, additional research will be needed to verify the validity of these measures. It is important to note that validity is not a property of a measure itself, but rather a process of evaluating evidence for the intended interpretation of instrument scores and their relevance for a particular population.44,45 In this population, strong relationships were demonstrated between validity indicators and most PRO measures. 

Author Manuscript 

The primary limitation of this report is that it was a secondary analysis of a sample of English-speaking participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial, that is, the study was not designed specifically to validate the PRO instruments. Thus, the available validity anchors were somewhat limited. Additional research is needed to establish minimally important differences to help investigators and clinicians interpret PRO data to use for estimating sample size or power for future studies. Additional research is also needed to validate the PRO instruments in people who speak languages other than English. In conclusion, among female patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer receiving breast or chest wall plus comprehensive nodal irradiation in the RadComp pragmatic randomized clinical trial, findings demonstrate high reliability and validity for important PRO measures, supporting their psychometric strength and usefulness to reflect the effect of radiation treatment on HRQL and supporting future RadComp and other comparative analyses of proton and photon therapy for breast cancer.

Abbreviations: FACT-B TOI = Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Trial Outcome Index; PRO = patient-reported outcome; PROMIS = Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; RT = radiation therapy; VAS = Visual Analog Scale from the EQ-5D. 

Entries in table denote Pearson correlation coefficient, P value, and sample size. —: not applicable. Completion of RT − baseline: Score at the completion of RT minus score at baseline. 6 mo. − completion of RT: Score at 6 months after the completion of RT minus score at the completion of RT. For FACT-B TOI, higher scores represent better health-related quality of life. For PROMIS, higher scores represent more of the outcome, eg, more fatigue, more anxiety, better ability. The VAS ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).
