Endocrine therapy (ET) is a cornerstone in the management of patients with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, which accounts for over 70% of cases worldwide. The efﬁcacy of adjuvant ET for 5 years in reducing the risk of recurrence and improving survival outcomes is well documented. However, the risk for late relapses, occurring >5 years after initial treatment, has prompted exploration of longer treatment durations. Extending ET beyond the traditional 5-year period offers additional beneﬁt in reducing the risk of recurrence and improving long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, determining the optimal duration and identifying suitable candidates for extended therapy is often nuanced. This review aims to comprehensively evaluate the current landscape of extended ET in breast cancer management. It provides an overview of the rationale behind extending endocrine treatment in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, with a focus on clinical trials and observational studies supporting extended therapy. Furthermore, it emphasizes the signiﬁcance of considering associated toxicities in patient management. It also explores novel strategies involving the combination of ET with new drugs, leading to an evolution of treatment paradigms that may make the need for extended therapy obsolete.

INTRODUCTION Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (BC) is deﬁned by the positive expression of estrogen receptors (1%) and/or progesterone receptors (1%).1-3 This subtype stands as the most common, accounting for almost 70% of all BC diagnoses.4 Adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) with tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), demonstrated its impact in reducing risk of relapse in early BC.5 Comparably, aromatase inhibitor (AI) can further reduce this risk by w30%.6,7 A standard duration of 5 years of adjuvant ET is indicated for all hormone receptor-positive BC, unless contraindicated.2 *Correspondence to: Dr Soraia Lobo-Martins, Institut Jules Bordet, Rue Meylemeersch, 90 (Rez Haut Nord), B-1070 Anderlecht, Belgium E-mail: soraialobomartins@gmail.com (S.

Despite such approach, risk of relapse in patients with hormone receptor-positive BC remains even 20 years after the initial diagnosis. In a meta-analysis led by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) on >80 trials and 80 000 patients, the rate of distant relapse at 15 years after ﬁnishing 5 years of adjuvant ET ranged from 13% to 41%, according to disease stage and tumour grade, and the tumour diameter and nodal status represented the strongest prognostic factors.8 Thus, extended adjuvant ET (EET) has been the subject of intense research activity in the last few years. The choice of the type and duration of ET for each patient in clinical practice is multifactorial and must consider, among others, patient menopausal status, risk of recurrence, ET toxicity proﬁle, and patient preferences.2 This review evaluates the current landscape of EET in BC, highlighting the rationale for extending treatment in premenopausal and postmenopausal women based on clinical trials and observational studies. We also discuss associated toxicities and explore novel combination strategies with new drugs to inform evolving treatment approaches (Figure 1). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057

chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, testing folliclestimulating hormone and oestradiol levels can help assess menopausal state, though these levels may temporarily mimic postmenopausal status, with ovarian function potentially recovering up to 2 years after chemotherapy.10 Though this hormonal change has a direct impact on the choice of the best adjuvant ET,11,12 adjuvant tamoxifen remains a standard approach in premenopausal patients.5 Given the greater reduction in recurrence risk with an AI compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women,6 studies questioned the effect of ovarian function suppression (OFS) in premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive BC, along with its combination with an AI or a SERM. A combined analysis of the SOFT and TEXT studies demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher 12-year rates of disease-free survival (DFS) but not overall survival (OS) when comparing exemestane plus OFS and tamoxifen plus OFS.13 High-risk patients exposed to chemotherapy beneﬁt more from combining OFS with AI.13 These results establish OFS as an important consort to adjuvant ET in premenopausal women.1 Additionally, a meta-analysis of four randomized clinical trials (RCTs) indicated a lower 5-year recurrence rate with OFS with AI compared with tamoxifen (6.9% versus 10.1%, P ¼ 0.0005).7 As referred, the choice of adjuvant ET in premenopausal women include tamoxifen alone, or OFS combined with tamoxifen or AI.11,12 Escalating treatment with cyclindependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and poly (ADPribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) has shown beneﬁts in high-risk patients,14-16 but the optimal duration of adjuvant ET beyond the 5 years remains unclear. The composite-risk Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot score was designed to illustrate the similarities between patients in SOFT and TEXT with characteristics of the patient tested regarding response to ET þ OFS in a median follow-up of 8-9 years. The composite-risk value was obtained from a Cox model that incorporated age, nodal status, tumour size, grade and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Ki-67 labelling index expression levels. Although not a prediction model, it allows the clinician to better understand those in need of escalating therapy in the ﬁrst 5 years, as this score provides knowledge of absolute improvements in 8-year freedom from distant recurrence with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen plus OFS or tamoxifen alone. As the potential beneﬁt of escalating ET is higher in high recurrence risk, these patients may beneﬁt from ET (available at https:// rconnect.dfci.harvard.edu/CompositeRiskSTEPP/).17 Current literature on selection of EET in premenopausal patients rely solely on subgroup analyses conducted within RCTs (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057). EET after upfront 5 years of tamoxifen The ATLAS trial explored the beneﬁt of 5 additional years of tamoxifen versus no EET following an initial 5 years of tamoxifen. In total, 12 894 women with early BC were enrolled, but only 1058 (8%) of them were identiﬁed as Volume 10 - Issue 5 - 2025 

ESMO Open premenopausal at the time of trial enrolment.18 In the overall population, EET resulted in reduced risk of recurrence [rate ratio (RR) 0.85, standard error (SE) 0.05, P ¼ 0.001]. BC-speciﬁc mortality (RR 0.84, SE 0.06, P ¼ 0.006) and overall mortality (RR 0.89, SE 0.04, P ¼ 0.01) were also improved (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.1050 57).18 When analysing the subgroup of premenopausal patients, similar results have been shown, where 64 of 326 patients (20%) in the EET arm and 73 of 304 patients (24%) in the control arm experienced recurrences after 10 years from randomization (RR 0.81, SE 0.15). Similarly, the aTToM study evaluated the beneﬁt of extending tamoxifen therapy to 10 years after 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, without age or menopausal state restriction. Overall, continuation of tamoxifen reduced BC recurrence (P ¼ 0.003) and BC mortality (P ¼ 0.05) (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/ 10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057). It is worth noting that the study was initially presented as an abstract and has not been formally published, with the data on the premenopausal population remaining undisclosed.19 A third but negative study, the NSABP B-14 trial, aimed to assess the efﬁcacy of EET with tamoxifen after 5 years of tamoxifen. It is of note that this trial enrolled only patients with node-negative disease. A total of 1172 women were enrolled of whom 26% were aged <50 years. This trial demonstrated no beneﬁt for EET, regardless of age.20 As menopausal status ﬂuctuates over the standard 5-year adjuvant ET period, trials beyond this timeframe for postmenopausal patients randomize those who were premenopausal at diagnosis and became postmenopausal during this period. It is the case of the NCIC CTGeMA.17 trial, designed to evaluate the efﬁcacy of EET with 5-year letrozole in postmenopausal women who have completed 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop. 2025.105057).21 Among the 5166 patients included, 877 were categorized as premenopausal when starting adjuvant tamoxifen. Overall, EET with letrozole notably increased DFS and revealed a marginal advantage in distant DFS (DDFS) for premenopausal women. It is of note that premenopausal women at diagnosis experienced a greater DFS beneﬁt with letrozole in EET than those postmenopausal at diagnosis [hazard ratio (HR) 0.26, P ¼ 0.0003 versus HR 0.67, P ¼ 0.006; respectively].22 Premenopausal patients with positive nodes had a signiﬁcant difference between letrozole and placebo in 4-year DFS [93.8% versus 85.0%, HR 0.40, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.18-0.85]. Results on premenopausal women with negative nodes cannot be analysed due to the fact that no events were observed in the letrozole arm, while 15.0% of premenopausal patients in the placebo arm had a 4-year DFS event.22 EET after ovarian function suppression There are no data so far supporting the continuation of ET beyond the ﬁfth year in premenopausal patients treated https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057

with 5 years of OFS in combination with either tamoxifen or exemestane. EET in these patients must be based on patient-adapted riskebeneﬁt ratio and menopausal status after the ﬁrst 5 years of adjuvant ET.2,12 A phase II study aiming to answer this question had been initiated by including patients who had already received >4.5 years of OFS to receive an additional 2 years of OFS; however, enrolment was discontinued after only 16 patients had been included out of a planned 50 patients, and the main reason was the difﬁculty for patients to tolerate OFS longer than the ﬁrst 5 years. Poor accrual suggests that young women may not be highly motivated to pursue longer time of OFS and that future studies of this approach may be challenging.23 EET in premenopausal patients is currently a subject of debate. This is due to lack of data on the beneﬁt of EET in patients with a high risk of recurrence who received 5 years of OFS with tamoxifen or AI. It is in such populations where potential candidates for EET reside. Furthermore, there are no available data on the beneﬁt of EET in premenopausal patients who received targeted drugs, such as CDK4/6i or PARPi. However, new trials involving oral selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs), such as CAMBRIA-1 (NCT05774951) and CAMBRIA-2 (NCT05952557), mandate the use of OFS for premenopausal women (in the experimental arm for CAMBRIA-1 and for both arms in CAMBRIA2), which will provide future data on extending OFS beyond 5 years.24,25 POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN Over 70% of new cases of BC were diagnosed in women over the age of 55 years in 2022 in the United States.26 As in premenopausal women, the continuation of ET beyond 5 years must be based on the riskebeneﬁt ratio, depending on risk of recurrence, previous treatments, competing comorbidities, side-effects, and patient’s preference (Figure 1).27 Based on the upfront strategy taken for the ﬁrst 5 years of adjuvant ET, different options for the extended period have been studied (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057). EET after upfront 5 years of tamoxifen Two studies have evaluated an additional 5 years of tamoxifen after an initial 5 years of tamoxifen: ATLAS18 and aTTom trials (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057). Both studies demonstrated a reduction in recurrence, BC mortality, and OS, with RR dependent on time [in ATLAS, BC outcomes presented an RR of 0.90 (95% CI 0.79-1.02) during years 5-9 and 0.75 (0.62-0.90) in later years].18,19 Alternatively, the EET can be proposed with 5 years of AI after 5 years of tamoxifen. Two trials, the MA.1728-30 and the NSABP B-3331 studies, investigated this option (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/ 10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057). In MA.17, risk of relapse, locoregional and distant, was reduced with EET by 4.6% and Volume 10 - Issue 5 - 2025 

ESMO Open 2.9%, respectively (5-year DFS, HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23-0.61; 5year DDFS, HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.73).28,29 This beneﬁt was seen independently of lymph node status and previous use of chemotherapy. Improvement in OS was demonstrated only in the subgroup of patients with axillary lymph node involvement (node-positive: HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.98; node-negative: HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.76-3.06).28,30 In the NSABP B-33 study, where 44% of patients crossed over from placebo to AI after unblinding, there was no difference in OS. However, exemestane exhibited a tendency for better DFS, particularly in node-positive disease (DFS, HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.86).31 In the ABCSG-6a trial, patients who remained disease free after 5 years of tamoxifen were randomized to receive either 3 years of anastrozole or no further treatment (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057). Risk of recurrence, local and distant, was reduced with additional treatment (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.96).32 

EET after sequencing tamoxifen and AI After 2-3 years of tamoxifen, patients can be proposed to switch to 2-3 years of AI (total of 5 years of adjuvant ET) or extended adjuvant AI to a total of 7/8 years of adjuvant ET (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057). In the GIM-4 trial, a total duration of 8 years of ET led to signiﬁcant advantages in both invasive DFS (iDFS) and OS, with absolute increases of 5% and 4%, respectively.33 It should be noted that patients with stage I-III histologically proven and operable invasive hormone receptor-positive BC were eligible and w40% of the patients included had nodepositive disease. DFS beneﬁt was more pronounced in patients 55 years old or more, and with node-negative disease.33 The greater beneﬁt in node-negative patients may result from the timing of randomization, which occurred after 2-3 years of tamoxifen; high-risk patients, such as those with node-positive disease, may have already experienced recurrence by that point and thus were not eligible for enrolment. In the NSABP B-4234,35 and AERAS36,37 trials, postmenopausal women were randomized to an additional 5 years of AI after 5 years of adjuvant ET (sequencing tamoxifen and AI, or just AI) (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop. 2025.105057). In both studies the exposure to tamoxifen was low. In NSABP B-42, w70% of patients received >4 years of AI as previous therapy. Those who received tamoxifen presented a better DFS (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.570.99; versus no tamoxifen, HR 0.91, 0.75-1.10), and for the entire population, the beneﬁt in DFS was only seen after a median follow-up of 10 years.34,35 In the AERAS trial, although only 10% of patients had received tamoxifen, 10 years of adjuvant ET was associated with a 7.5% absolute reduction at 5-year DFS.36,37 Neither study demonstrated OS advantages. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057

ESMO Open In trying to understand the adequate time duration of EET, the DATA study demonstrated a better tendency favouring EET with 6 years of anastrozole in DFS compared with 3 years of anastrozole (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop. 2025.105057).38 An exploratory subgroup analysis revealed a greater beneﬁt with 6 years of EET in patients who had received chemotherapy (10-year DFS, absolute beneﬁt of 3.9%).38 Two studies compared 7-7.5 years to 10 years of EET with no improvements in outcomes, DFS or OS (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057). In the IDEAL trial, 60% of patients were previously treated with sequential tamoxifen and AI, and 25% did not have nodal involvement.39 In the ABCSG-16 trial, 40% received sequential and 30% presented positive lymph node disease.40 More recently, a prospective-retrospective translational study of IDEAL demonstrated that patients at high risk of recurrence assessed by the Breast Cancer Index (BCI) derived an absolute beneﬁt of 9.8% on recurrence with 10 years of adjuvant ET (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.84, P ¼ 0.011).41 However, these ﬁndings suggest that patients who receive AI upfront are unlikely to gain additional beneﬁt from extending ET beyond 7-8 years, emphasizing the need for careful patient selection in determining EET duration. EET after 10 years of ET In the MA.17R, 1918 postmenopausal women who had already completed a full 10 years of adjuvant ET [4.5-6 years of tamoxifen (w70%) followed by 4.5-6 years of AI] were randomized to receive an additional 5 years of letrozole or placebo (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057).42 Despite DFS favouring EET (P ¼ 0.01), distant recurrence differences were modest (4.4% for letrozole versus 5.5% for placebo) and no OS beneﬁt was demonstrated.42 Alternative regimens Trying to overcome secondary resistance to ET, the SOLE trial assessed the superiority of intermittent versus continuous letrozole, for an additional 5 years in postmenopausal women who were relapse free after 4-6 years of adjuvant ET.43,44 The biological rational was based on animal models, where resistance was reversed with intermittent treatment with AI. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint, with similar 7-year DFS (HR 1.03, P ¼ 0.64) and similar rates of reported adverse events (AEs) in both arms.43,44 Intermittent administration was associated with less symptom worsening during the ﬁrst year of treatment, particularly hot ﬂushes, vaginal problems, musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbances, physical well-being, and mood alterations.45 Although not designed for non-inferiority, intermittent administration might be considered for women experiencing decreased quality of life (QoL) due to symptom burden. 6

Haddad et al. showed a threefold increase in risk of BC events, for patients who presented higher levels of estrone or oestradiol while on anastrozole therapy.46 Among postmenopausal women, they studied the role of high doses of anastrozole in patients with inadequate suppression of estrogen levels (w30% of the population in the study). With dose escalation, the majority achieved adequate values of suppression.46 Hence, we are now facing a shift in the paradigm of the standard doses of ET, especially in the concept of ‘one size ﬁts all’. 

NEW COMBINATIONS New targeted agents such as CDK4/6i or PARPi have contributed for important improvements in survival outcomes for the metastatic setting. Several trials evaluated the role of these compounds in the adjuvant setting (Table 1). Initial ﬁndings from the PALLAS and Penelope-B trials, which investigated the use of palbociclib in combination with adjuvant ET in high-risk patients, failed to show improved outcomes, and therefore, palbociclib is not approved in the adjuvant setting.14,47-50 On the contrary, in the monarchE trial, the addition of 2 years of abemaciclib to ET showed an absolute increase of 7.6% and 6.7% in 5-year iDFS and DDFS, respectively.15,51 Likewise, the results for the NATALEE trial showed that ribociclib induces an absolute beneﬁt of 3.3% and 2.2% in terms of iDFS and DDFS, respectively, at 3 years (P < 0.005) and follow-up of patients continue in this trial.16,52 Of note, w30% of patients eligible for NATALEE would not be eligible for monarchE. In the OlympiA trial, adjuvant olaparib demonstrated signiﬁcant survival beneﬁts in patients with germline BRCA 1/2 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative BC, with a 9.9% increase in 3-year iDFS and 3.4% increase in 4year OS.14,53 These beneﬁts also exist in the subgroup of hormone receptor-positive BC patients, although with limited data due to their smaller representation in the trial (18.2%).14,53 For patients eligible for both CDK4/6i and olaparib, the best option or sequence is yet unknown.54 The 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines do not recommend combining the two therapies, but do consider the possibility of sequential therapy starting with olaparib.1 The implications of extended duration of ET combined with CDK4/6i remain uncertain, as the carry-over effect of these drugs is not well established. In monarchE, 2 years of abemaciclib has impacted iDFS at 5 years, while palbociclib did not seem to present the same effect in the Penelope-B trial.49,51 Currently, the long-term impact of the addition of these agents is still unknown. Patients included in these four trials will receive at least 5 years of ET. However, how many will extend adjuvant treatment with ET is not clear. Moreover, since these patients are at high risk, it is advisable to continue EET for at least 7-8 years and in some cases up to 10 years. Volume 10 - Issue 5 - 2025

ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXICITIES Despite the demonstrated beneﬁt on clinical outcomes,55 adjuvant ET with tamoxifen or AI is associated with sideeffects that can negatively impact QoL and treatment adherence (Figure 3).56 Early discontinuation and nonadherence to ET have been linked to increased mortality in BC survivors57 and the rate of discontinuation range from 31% to 73% after 5 years of adjuvant ET.58 Importantly, early discontinuation is also substantial within the ﬁrst 5 years, varying between 35% and 50%.56,59 Therefore, continuous monitoring of side-effects and optimizing their management are paramount. Osteoporosis and bone fractures Circulating estrogens play a crucial role in regulating bone turnover by inﬂuencing osteoblastic and osteoclastic 8

activities.60 Consequently, estrogen deﬁciency increases the rate of bone loss leading to osteoporosis and a higher risk of bone fractures. In postmenopausal women, adjuvant tamoxifen plays an estrogen-agonistic effect on bone, reducing bone loss.61 However, its effects on bone density can vary depending on the menopausal status. In premenopausal women it can induce bone loss, especially in the lumbar spine, increasing the risk of osteoporosis.62,63 Bone fracture rates were similar in 10 versus 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61-1.21).18 Bone-related toxicities seem to be higher in patients receiving EET with AI. In trials such as MA.17 and ABCSG-6a, where patients switched from tamoxifen to extended AI therapy, differences were observed in fracture rates. The ABCSG-6a trial, which involved an additional 3 years of AI, showed similar fracture incidence between treatment arms (0.8% for observation versus 1.1% for anastrozole),32 Volume 10 - Issue 5 - 2025 

S. Lobo-Martins et al. 

whereas the MA.17 trial, with an additional 5 years of AI, reported increased clinical fractures (5.2% versus 3.1%, P ¼ 0.02) and diagnoses of osteoporosis (5.3% versus 1.6%, P < 0.0001).29 Moreover, in trials with sequential ET with tamoxifen followed by AI, such as GIM-4, DATA, and AERAS, increased rates of fractures, osteoporosis, and osteopenia were consistently observed.33,37,38 However, the NSABP-42 trial reported similar incidence of osteoporotic fractures (4.8% versus 5.4%).34 For those treated with AI for 10 years, such as in the MA.17R trial, even with bisphosphonate use, prolonged AI therapy for 10 years was associated with a higher incidence of fractures, highlighting the ongoing risk despite preventive measures (14% versus 9%, P ¼ 0.001).42 In addition to ﬁndings from individual trials, two metaanalyses, of 7 and 11 RCTs, revealed an increase in bone fractures in the group of patients treated with extended AI [odds ratio (OR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.16-1.55; and OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.18-1.59, respectively].64,65 Given the signiﬁcant impact of EET on bone health, in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, it is crucial to clearly explain the potential risks of bone loss and fractures to all patients before the start of treatment. Implementing proactive strategies and lifestyle modiﬁcation to prevent osteoporosis and fractures is essential to reduce the risk of complications associated with EET. Weightbearing exercises, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, and smoking cessation can signiﬁcantly contribute to maintain bone health.63,66 Additionally, close monitoring of bone density and early intervention with pharmacological agents are key components of fracture prevention strategies.63,67 Endometrial cancer The use of tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and the incidence appears to increase when prolonging therapy beyond 5 years.5,68 The aTTom trial showed an increased risk of endometrial cancer with 10 years of tamoxifen versus 5 years (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.312.34) with more endometrial cancer death (1.1% versus 0.6%, absolute hazard 0.5%, P ¼ 0.02).19 Similarly, in the ATLAS trial, endometrial cancer incidence during years 5-14 was 3.1% in the prolonged tamoxifen arm versus 1.6% in the control arm (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.30-2.34).18 Cardiovascular adverse events Circulating estrogens play a role in cardiometabolic health. Among patients with early BC, cardiovascular death emerges as a signiﬁcant competing risk, in particular for older woman 5 years after the diagnosis.69 Lowering circulating estrogen levels is associated with detrimental effects on both blood vessels and myocardium.70 Ten years of tamoxifen use was associated with higher rates of pulmonary embolus (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.13-3.07) and lower rates of ischaemic heart disease (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95). Additionally, the risk of stroke was similar in the two arms (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83-1.36).18 Compared with tamoxifen, the use of AI is associated with higher incidence of Volume 10 - Issue 5 - 2025 

ESMO Open cardiovascular disease, and prolonged therapy is associated with even higher risk.64,71 The impact of EET on cardiovascular toxicity is still controversial. The MA.17 trial revealed no signiﬁcant difference in cardiovascular events between treatment arms (4.1% versus 3.1%, P ¼ 0.17).29 In sequential ET trials such as GIM-4 and DATA, no disparities in cardiovascular events were observed, while GIM-4 showed a higher incidence of grade 1 hypertension (1.8% versus 0.7%).33,38 However, the NSABP B-42 study reported increased thrombotic events following prolonged letrozole therapy (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.18-2.88).34 On the other hand, the MA.17R trial, involving 10 years of AI therapy, showed no signiﬁcant difference in cardiovascular events (12% versus 10%, P ¼ 0.21).42 These ﬁndings emphasize the necessity for tailored approaches to mitigate cardiac toxicity risks in patients with hormone receptor-positive BC undergoing EET. Quality of life and adherence QoL and adherence are critical considerations in the use of EET. Ferreira et al. revealed that QoL deterioration can persist up to 2 years after diagnosis, with ET having a more signiﬁcant negative impact than chemotherapy.72 This underscores the need for careful patient selection when considering ET escalation, as long-term QoL impacts may inﬂuence treatment tolerance. Persistent, bothersome symptoms, such as insomnia, fatigue, menopausal symptoms, and arthralgia, often lead to early discontinuation of ET. Pistilli et al. further highlighted adherence issues, ﬁnding that 16% of patients had tamoxifen serum levels below the adherence threshold, despite more than half of these patients self-reporting adherence.73 Nonadherent patients demonstrated signiﬁcantly shorter DDFS.73 Although there is limited evidence on QoL speciﬁcally in EET, smaller studies, such as that by Kool et al.74, provide some insights. Larger prospective cohorts, such as the CANTO study (NCT01993498),75 may offer valuable insights into patientreported outcomes in EET, addressing the ongoing need to balance efﬁcacy with tolerability in long-term therapy. PREDICTING LATE RELAPSES Hormone receptor-positive BC is the most susceptible subtype of late recurrences,8,9 with around 20%-40% of patients developing distant metastasis, half of which occur 5 or more years after the primary tumour diagnosis.76 This underscores the importance of predicting the personal risk and of adjusting adjuvant ET accordingly. Continuing adjuvant ET beyond 5 years must be considered based on a riskebeneﬁt assessment, as EET is associated with AEs that must be weighed in the therapeutic decision. While traditional criteria such as tumour size, lymph node involvement, and tumour grade consistently correlate with late recurrences,77-79 determining which patients are at real risk of late recurrences remains challenging. In recent years, various tools have emerged to aid physicians in this effort, assessing both adjuvant treatment beneﬁt and risk of late BC recurrences. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057

ESMO Open Online clinical tools The Clinical Treatment Score post-5 years (CTS5) is a freely accessible online tool designed to estimate the risk of late recurrences in postmenopausal patients who have completed 5 years of adjuvant ET without recurrence.80 Developed according to clinicopathological parameters from the ATAC trial as the training set and the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial as the testing set,81,82 CTS5 uses tumour size and grade, number of involved nodes, and patients’ age at diagnosis to identify patients at higher risk of recurrence and for whom EET can be useful.80,83 A retrospective study by Richman et al. found a 10year distant relapse risk of 2.9% for the CTS5-low group, compared with 7.2% for the intermediate-risk and 12.9% for the high-risk groups, suggesting patients with a higher CTS5 risk may beneﬁt substantially from adjuvant ET beyond 5 years.84 Genomic testing To date, several genomic multi-parametric tests have been designed to assess an individual’s risk of BC recurrence by analysing the expression proﬁle of speciﬁc cancer-related genes. The OncotypeDX, PAM50, MammaPrint, and EndoPredict assays have been developed based on intrinsic tumour biology to try to predict the beneﬁt of de-escalating adjuvant chemotherapy.85 However, many of these tests are not created to predict late recurrences in addition to early recurrences (relapse <5 years after initial treatment) and only a few have shown to be prognostic for late relapses (Table 2).79 OncotypeDX, a well-established multi-gene assay, assesses the risk of recurrence in women with hormone receptor-positive BC. In the transATAC trial, it was not predictive of late distant recurrences (years 5-10) when adjusted for clinical parameters.78,113 The PAM50 Prosigna assay added prognostic information for distant late 

recurrences and was more effective than OncotypeDX.114 The MammaPrint assay has also been evaluated in many subgroups of patients, but the prognostic information added by this assay is limited to the ﬁrst 5 years after diagnosis and there are no solid data regarding the potential role of MammaPrint in informing the potential beneﬁts of EET.116 The EndoPredict assay and EPclin score have been developed with the aim of combining the EndoPredict score with clinical information, such as nodal status and tumour size.115 Both are available as continuous scores or categorized into low- and high-risk groups. These signatures have been speciﬁcally investigated for their association with late distant recurrences, with EPclin demonstrating superior predictive accuracy compared with the genomic score alone.115 Patients with negative lymph nodes or 1-3 positive lymph nodes and who have already completed 5 years of adjuvant ET may have EET-guided decision based on their BCI.117 BCI is an RTePCR test that can be carried out on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded BC tissue and integrates two biomarkers based on the expression of both genes that assess tumour responsiveness to ET (HOXB13 : IL17BR ratio) and the molecular grade index (MGI), which consists of the average expression of ﬁve cell cycle-associated genes. The BCI test is able to provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of late distant recurrences 5 years after diagnosis and the cumulative risk of distant recurrence over 10 years, and a prediction of the probability of beneﬁt from EET.117 An exploratory analysis was also carried out to further clarify which of the two components of the BCI score predicts late distant recurrences, and results showed that only the HOXB13 : IL17BR ratio signiﬁcantly predicted late recurrences.118 MGI seems not to be prognostic for late distant recurrences, similarly to proliferation-related tumour markers such as Ki67 or clinical tumour grade.78 Although these tests provide insights for predicting late recurrences, the decision to continue ET beyond the ﬁrst 5

years must always account for the context of the single patient. OPEN QUESTIONS In the context of hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative advanced BC, patients who progressed on CDK4/6i do not seem to derive the same beneﬁt from continuing standard ET. As so, several novel ETs are being studied: SERDs (e.g. elacestrant), complete estrogen receptor antagonists (CERANs; e.g. palazestrant; NCT04505826, NCT05508906, NCT05266105), proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC, e.g. vepdegestrant/ARV-471), selective estrogen receptor covalent antagonists (SERCAs; e.g. H3B-6545; NCT04288089), SERMs (e.g. lasofoxifene; NCT01042379, NCT05696626).86 Some of these drugs are already being tested in clinical trials in patients with early disease, in particular oral SERD, PROTAC, and SERM (Supplementary Table S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057).87-100 Trials such as CAMBRIA-1 and EMBER-4 are searching the added value of new anti-estrogen-receptor therapies in patients already treated for 2-5 years with standard ET  CDK4/ 6i.101 Additionally, the coopERA study, a phase II trial, has shown promising results for oral SERDs plus palbociclib, demonstrating signiﬁcant reductions in Ki67 levels after 2 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy.102 The introduction of immunotherapy in hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative BC is supported by early results from KEYNOTE 756 and CHECKMATE 7FL.103,104 The combination of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 agents with neoadjuvant chemotherapy increased rates of pathological complete response compared with placebo. However, with short follow-up durations, long-term efﬁcacy remains unclear, particularly with EET. Additionally, the potential for combining these therapies with CDK4/6i and their additional/synergistic effect is still under investigation. Moreover, antibodyedrug conjugates are being explored in an earlier setting of BC and a new generation of CDK4/6i is coming, more selective for CDK4105 or even CDK2106 (Supplementary Table S2, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.esmoop.2025.105057). The impact of these combinations in adjuvant ET, particularly EET, is not known and will remain unknown, until the follow-up for these trials is long enough to allow some conclusions. CONCLUSIONS The broad investigation of EET through several trials has left the search for the optimal agent and treatment duration somewhat unclear. Such complexities are pronounced in premenopausal women, where ongoing debates persist due to lack of strong evidence, particularly in patients who have received OFS with tamoxifen or AIs during the ﬁrst 5 years of adjuvant ET. Conversely, in postmenopausal patients, there is evidence in favour of prolonging adjuvant ET, particularly among those with an increased risk of recurrence (such as the use of adjuvant chemotherapy or the presence of positive lymph nodes) and those who have been exposed to tamoxifen during the ﬁrst 5 years of Volume 10 - Issue 5 - 2025 

ESMO Open treatment; however, high rates of hot ﬂushes, vaginal symptoms, and the increased risk of osteoporosis (particularly in cases treated with long-lasting AI) underline the delicate balance between therapeutic beneﬁts and adverse effects, potentially leading to lower rates of patient compliance. Supporting the choice of prolonged treatment means balancing the QoL against the costs of toxicity (Figure 1). The evolving therapeutic landscape for patients with hormone receptor-positive BC is witnessing the integration of new targeted agents like CDK4/6i and PARPi, adding complexity to the search for evidence supporting prolonged ET. While the standard minimum duration of adjuvant therapy in these trials is 5 years, patients have the option to extend this treatment. However, due to the relatively short follow-up periods in trials assessing these new agents, the long-term impact (over 10-15 years) of incorporating these treatments remains uncertain and should be conﬁrmed. As research progresses, it becomes imperative to bridge these knowledge gaps to reﬁne and personalize the approach to prolonged adjuvant ET, ensuring optimal outcomes for patients with BC in the constantly evolving landscape of oncology.
